precoded ofdm with adaptive vector channel allocation for scalable video . <eos> orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) has been applied in broadband wireline and wireless systems for high data rate transmission where severe intersymbol interference ( isi ) always occurs . the conventional ofdm system provides advantages through conversion of an isi channel into isi free subchannels at multiple frequency bands . however , it may suffer from channel spectral nulls and heavy data rate overhead due to cyclic prefix insertion . previously , a new ofdm framework , the precoded ofdm , has been proposed to mitigate the above two problems through precoding and conversion of an isi channel into isi free vector channels . in this paper , we consider the application of the precoded ofdm system to efficient scalable video transmission . we propose to enhance the precoded ofdm system with adaptive vector channel allocation to provide stronger protection against errors to more important layers in the layered bit stream structure of scalable video . the more critical layers , or equivalently , the lower layers , are allocated vector channels of higher transmission quality . the channel quality is characterized by frobenius norm metrics based on channel estimation at the receiver . the channel allocation information is fed back periodically to the transmitter through a control channel . simulation results have demonstrated the robustness of the proposed scheme to noise and fading inherent in wireless channels

on the emergence of rules in neural networks . <eos> grammars ) from sequences of arbitrary input symbols by inventing abstract representations that accommodate unseen symbol sets as well as unseen but similar grammars . the neural network is shown to have the ability to transfer grammatical knowledge to both new symbol vocabularies and new grammars . analysis of the state space shows that the network learns generalized abstract structures of the input and is not simply memorizing the input strings . these representations are context sensitive , hierarchical , and based on the state variable of the finite state machines that the neural network has learned . generalization to new symbol sets or grammars arises from the spatial nature of the internal representations used by the network , allowing new symbol sets to be encoded close to symbol sets that have already been learned in the hidden unit space of the network . the results are counter to the arguments that learning algorithms based on weight adaptation after each exemplar presentation ( such as the long term potentiation found in the mammalian nervous system ) can not in principle extract symbolic knowledge from positive examples as prescribed by prevailing human linguistic theory and evolutionary psychology
streaming , disruptive interference and power law behavior in the exit dynamics . <eos> we analyze the exit dynamics of pedestrians who are initially confined in a room . pedestrians are modeled as cellular automata and compete to escape via a known exit at the soonest possible time . a pedestrian could move forward , backward , left or right within each iteration time depending on adjacent cell vacancy and in accordance with simple rules that determine the compulsion to move and physical capability relative to his neighbors . the arching signatures of jamming were observed and the pedestrians exited in bursts of various sizes . power law behavior is found in the burst size frequency distribution for exit widths w greater than one cell dimension ( w > <digit> ) . the slope of the power law curve varies with w from <digit> . <digit> ( w <digit> ) to <digit> . <digit> ( w <digit> ) . streaming which is a diffusive behavior , arises in large burst sizes and is more likely in a single exit room with w <digit> and leads to a counterintuitive result wherein an average exit throughput q is obtained that is higher than with w <digit> , <digit> , or <digit> . for a two exit room ( w <digit> ) , q is not greater than twice the yield of a single exit room . if the doors are not separated far enough ( < 4w ) , q becomes even significantly less due to a collective slow down that emerges among pedestrians crossing in each other ' s path ( disruptive interference effect ) . for the same w and door number , q is also higher with relaxed pedestrians than with anxious ones

phase control of higher order squeezing of a quantum field . <eos> photon statistics in a c . w . system has been observed in the mixing of a coherent field with a two photon source . their system has the advantage over other atomic transition based fluorescent systems . in this paper , we examine further the squeezing properties of higher order quantum fluctuations in one of the quadrature components of the combined field in this system . we demonstrate that efficient and lasting higher order squeezing effects could be observed with proper choice of the relative phase between the pump and coherent fields . this nonclassical feature is attributed to a constructive two photon interference . relationship between the second and higher order squeezing of the field is discussed
modeling self consistent multi class dynamic traffic flow . <eos> traffic model derived from the vehicular boltzmann equation and the traffic dispersion model . the multilane domain is considered as a two dimensional space and the interaction among vehicles in the domain is described by a dispersion model . the reason we consider a multilane domain as a two dimensional space is that the driving behavior of road users may not be restricted by lanes , especially motorcyclists . the dispersion model , which is a nonlinear poisson equation , is derived from the car following theory and the equilibrium assumption . under the concept that all kinds of users share the finite section , the density is distributed on a road by the dispersion model . in addition , the dynamic evolution of the traffic flow is determined by the systematic gas kinetic model derived from the boltzmann equation . multiplying boltzmann equation by the zeroth , first and second order moment functions , integrating both side of the equation and using chain rules , we can derive continuity , motion and variance equation , respectively . however , the second order moment function , which is the square of the individual velocity , is employed by previous researches does not have physical meaning in traffic flow

exploring developments in web based relationship marketing within the hotel . <eos> this paper provides a content analysis study of the application of world wide web marketing by the hotel industry . there is a lack of historical perspective on industry related web marketing applications and this paper attempts to resolve this with a two year follow up case study of the changing use of the web to develop different types of relationships . specifically , the aims are ( <digit> ) to identify key changes in the way hotels are using the web ( <digit> ) to look for evidence of the adoption of a relationship marketing ( rm ) model as a strategy for the development of hotel web sites and the use of new technologies and , ( <digit> ) to investigate the use of multimedia in hotel web sites . the development and strategic exploitation of the internet has transformed the basis of marketing . using the evidence from a web content survey this study reveals the way relationships are being created and managed within the hotel industry by its use of the web as a marketing tool . the authors have collected evidence by means of a descriptive study on the way hotels build and create relationships with their web presence delivering multimedia information as well as channel and interactive means of communication . in addition a strategic framework is offered as the means to describe the mechanism and orientation of web based marketing by hotels . the study utilizes a model by gilbert ( <digit> ) as a means of developing a measurement instrument to allow a content analysis of the current approach by hotels to the development of web sites . the results indicate hotels are aware of the new uses of web technology and are promoting hotel products in the global electronic market in new and sophisticated ways
online auctions dynamic pricing and the lodging industry . <eos> rapidly being displaced by web site scripting , online intermediaries , and specialty brokers . businesses that pioneered internet usage relied on it as a sales and marketing alternative to predecessor product distribution channels . as such , web sites replace the traditional trading model to the internet . web enabled companies are popular because the medium renders the process faster , less costly , highly reliable , and secure . auction based models impact business models by converting the price setting mechanism from supplier centric to market centric and transforming the trading model from one to many to many to many . historically , pricing was based on the cost of production plus a margin of profit . traditionally , as products and services move through the supply chain , from the producer to the consumer , various intermediaries added their share of profit to the price . as internet based mediums of distribution become more prevalent , traditional pricing models are being supplanted with dynamic pricing . a dynamic pricing model represents a flexible system that changes prices not only from product to product , but also from customer to customer and transaction to transaction . many industry leaders are skeptical of the long run impact of online auctions on lodging industry profit margins , despite the fact pricing theory suggests that an increase in the flow of information results in efficient market pricing . the future of such endeavors remains promising , but controversial

efficient computation of local geometric moments . <eos> as edge detection and texture segmentation . the main reason for this is that they are inherently integral based features , so that their use reduces the effect of uncorrelated noise . the computation of local moments , when viewed as a neighborhood operation , can be interpreted as a convolution of the image with a set of masks . nevertheless , moments computed inside overlapping windows are not independent and convolution does not take this fact into account . by introducing a matrix formulation and the concept of accumulation moments , this paper presents an algorithm which is computationally much more efficient than convolving and yet as simple
adaptive image denoising using scale and space consistency . <eos> based on image multiresolution decomposition by a redundant wavelet transform . in our approach , edges are implicitly located and preserved in the wavelet domain , whilst image noise is filtered out . at each resolution level , the image edges are estimated by gradient magnitudes ( obtained from the wavelet coefficients ) , which are modeled probabilistically , and a shrinkage function is assembled based on the model obtained . joint use of space and scale consistency is applied for better preservation of edges . the shrinkage functions are combined to preserve edges that appear simultaneously at several resolutions , and geometric constraints are applied to preserve edges that are not isolated . the proposed technique produces a filtered version of the original image , where homogeneous regions appear separated by well defined edges . possible applications include image presegmentation , and image denoising
tracking nonparameterized object contours in video . <eos> transform of the edge map is used as an edge indicator function for contour detection . using the concept of topographical distance , the watershed segmentation can be formulated as a minimization . this new viewpoint gives a way to combine the results of the watershed algorithm on different surfaces . in particular , our algorithm determines the contour as a combination of the current edge map and the contour , predicted from the tracking result in the previous frame . we also show that the problem of background clutter can be relaxed by taking the object motion into account . the compensation with object motion allows to detect and remove spurious edges in background . the experimental results confirm the expected advantages of the proposed method over the existing approaches
multilayered image representation application to image compression . <eos> and image compression . we describe a new multilayered representation technique for images . an image is parsed into a superposition of coherent layers piecewise smooth regions layer , textures layer , etc . the multilayered decomposition algorithm consists in a cascade of compressions applied successively to the image itself and to the residuals that resulted from the previous compressions . during each iteration of the algorithm , we code the residual part in a lossy way we only retain the most significant structures of the residual part , which results in a sparse representation . each layer is encoded independently with a different transform , or basis , at a different bitrate , and the combination of the compressed layers can always be reconstructed in a meaningful way . the strength of the multilayer approach comes from the fact that different sets of basis functions complement each others some of the basis functions will give reasonable account of the large trend of the data , while others will catch the local transients , or the oscillatory patterns . this multilayered representation has a lot of beautiful applications in image understanding , and image and video coding . we have implemented the algorithm and we have studied its capabilities
combining spatial and scale space techniques for edge detection to provide a . <eos> new methods for detecting edges in an image using spatial and scale space domains are proposed . a priori knowledge about geometrical characteristics of edges is used to assign a probability factor to the chance of any pixel being on an edge . an improved double thresholding technique is introduced for spatial domain filtering . probabilities that pixels belong to a given edge are assigned based on pixel similarity across gradient amplitudes , gradient phases and edge connectivity . the scale space approach uses dynamic range compression to allow wavelet correlation over a wider range of scales . a probabilistic formulation is used to combine the results obtained from filtering in each domain to provide a final edge probability image which has the advantages of both spatial and scale space domain methods . decomposing this edge probability image with the same wavelet as the original image permits the generation of adaptive filters that can recognize the characteristics of the edges in all wavelet detail and approximation images regardless of scale . these matched filters permit significant reduction in image noise without contributing to edge distortion . the spatially adaptive wavelet noise filtering algorithm is qualitatively and quantitatively compared to a frequency domain and two wavelet based noise suppression algorithms using both natural and computer generated noisy images
computational capacity of an odorant discriminator the linear separability of . <eos> we introduce and study an artificial neural network inspired by the probabilistic receptor affinity distribution model of olfaction . our system consists of n sensory neurons whose outputs converge on a single processing linear threshold element . the system ' s aim is to model discrimination of a single target odorant from a large number p of background odorants within a range of odorant concentrations . we show that this is possible provided p does not exceed a critical value p sub c and calculate the critical capacity alpha c p sub c n . the critical capacity depends on the range of concentrations in which the discrimination is to be accomplished . if the olfactory bulb may be thought of as a collection of such processing elements , each responsible for the discrimination of a single odorant , our study provides a quantitative analysis of the potential computational properties of the olfactory bulb . the mathematical formulation of the problem we consider is one of determining the capacity for linear separability of continuous curves , embedded in a large dimensional space . this is accomplished here by a numerical study , using a method that signals whether the discrimination task is realizable , together with a finite size scaling analysis
lossy to lossless object based coding of <digit> d mri data . <eos> exploiting the diagnostic relevance of the different regions of the volumetric data for rate allocation . the data are first decorrelated via a <digit> d discrete wavelet transform . the implementation via the lifting steps scheme allows to map integer to integer values , enabling lossless coding , and facilitates the definition of the object based inverse transform . the coding process assigns disjoint segments of the bitstream to the different objects , which can be independently accessed and reconstructed at any up to lossless quality . two fully <digit> d coding strategies are considered embedded zerotree coding ( ezw 3d ) and multidimensional layered zero coding ( mlzc ) , both generalized for region of interest ( roi ) based processing . in order to avoid artifacts along region boundaries , some extra coefficients must be encoded for each object . this gives rise to an overheading of the bitstream with respect to the case where the volume is encoded as a whole . the amount of such extra information depends on both the filter length and the decomposition depth . the system is characterized on a set of head magnetic resonance images . results show that mlzc and ezw 3d have competitive performances . in particular , the best mlzc mode outperforms the others state of the art techniques on one of the datasets for which results are available in the literature

on optimality in auditory information processing . <eos> the primary part of the mammalian auditory system using a stochastic fitzhugh nagumo model and an action recovery model for synaptic depression . our overall model covers the chain from a hair cell to a point just after the synaptic connection with a cell in the cochlear nucleus . the information processing performance of the system is evaluated using so called phi divergences from statistics that quantify dissimilarity between probability measures and are intimately related to a number of fundamental limits in statistics and information theory ( it ) . we show that there exists a set of parameters that can optimize several important phi divergences simultaneously and that this set corresponds to a constant quiescent firing rate ( qfr ) of the spiral ganglion neuron . the optimal value of the qfr is frequency dependent but is essentially independent of the amplitude of the signal ( for small amplitudes ) . consequently , optimal processing according to several standard it criteria can be accomplished for this model if and only if the parameters are tuned to values that correspond to one and the same qfr . this offers a new explanation for the qfr and can provide new insight into the role played by several other parameters of the peripheral auditory system

a framework for evaluating the data hiding capacity of image sources . <eos> presented in this paper . previous theoretical results are used to characterize the fundamental capacity limits of image watermarking and data hiding systems . capacity is determined by the statistical model used for the host image , by the distortion constraints on the data hider and the attacker , and by the information available to the data hider , to the attacker , and to the decoder . we consider autoregressive , block dct , and wavelet statistical models for images and compute data hiding capacity for compressed and uncompressed host image sources . closed form expressions are obtained under sparse model approximations . models for geometric attacks and distortion measures that are invariant to such attacks are considered
geometrically invariant watermarking using feature points . <eos> robustness to geometrical distortions . the weaknesses of classical watermarking methods to geometrical distortions are outlined first . geometrical distortions can be decomposed into two classes global transformations such as rotations and translations and local transformations such as the stirmark attack . an overview of existing self synchronizing schemes is then presented . theses schemes can use periodical properties of the mark , invariant properties of transforms , template insertion , or information provided by the original image to counter geometrical distortions . thereafter , a new class of watermarking schemes using the image content is presented . we propose an embedding and detection scheme where the mark is bound with a content descriptor defined by salient points . three different types of feature points are studied and their robustness to geometrical transformations is evaluated to develop an enhanced detector . the embedding of the signature is done by extracting feature points of the image and performing a delaunay tessellation on the set of points . the mark is embedded using a classical additive scheme inside each triangle of the tessellation . the detection is done using correlation properties on the different triangles . the performance of the presented scheme is evaluated after jpeg compression , geometrical attack and transformations . results show that the fact that the scheme is robust to these different manipulations . finally , in our concluding remarks , we analyze the different perspectives of such content based watermarking scheme

quality image metrics for synthetic images based on perceptual color . <eos> due to the improvement of image rendering processes , and the increasing importance of quantitative comparisons among synthetic color images , it is essential to define perceptually based metrics which enable to objectively assess the visual quality of digital simulations . in response to this need , this paper proposes a new methodology for the determination of an objective image quality metric , and gives an answer to this problem through three metrics . this methodology is based on the llab color space for perception of color in complex images , a modification of the cielab1976 color space . the first metric proposed is a pixel by pixel metric which introduces a local distance map between two images . the second metric associates , to a pair of images , a global value . finally , the third metric uses a recursive subdivision of the images to obtain an adaptative distance map , rougher but less expensive to compute than the first method

preintegration lateral inhibition enhances unsupervised learning . <eos> postintegration lateral inhibition as a mechanism for competition . we argue that these algorithms are computationally deficient in that they fail to generate , or learn , appropriate perceptual representations under certain circumstances . an alternative neural network architecture is presented here in which nodes compete for the right to receive inputs rather than for the right to generate outputs . this form of competition , implemented through preintegration lateral inhibition , does provide appropriate coding properties and can be used to learn such representations efficiently . furthermore , this architecture is consistent with both neuroanatomical and neuropsychological data . we thus argue that preintegration lateral inhibition has computational advantages over conventional neural network architectures while remaining equally biologically plausible
generalized predictive control for non uniformly sampled systems . <eos> sampling patterns , which include multirate sampled data systems as special cases . we derive lifted models in the state space domain . the main obstacle for generalized predictive control ( gpc ) design using the lifted models is the so called causality constraint . taking into account this design constraint , we propose a new gpc algorithm , which results in optimal causal control laws for the non uniformly sampled systems . the solution applies immediately to multirate sampled data systems where rates are integer multiples of some base period

state of the art in orthopaedic surgical navigation with a focus on medical . <eos> this paper presents a review of surgical navigation systems in orthopaedics and categorizes these systems according to the image modalities that are used for the visualization of surgical action . medical images used to be an essential part of surgical education and documentation as well as diagnosis and operation planning over many years . with the recent introduction of navigation techniques in orthopaedic surgery , a new field of application has been opened . today surgical navigation systems also known as image guided surgery systems are available for various applications in orthopaedic surgery . they visualize the position and orientation of surgical instruments as graphical overlays onto a medical image of the operated anatomy on a computer monitor . preoperative image data such as computed tomography scans or intra operatively generated images ( for example , ultrasonic , endoscopic or fluoroscopic images ) are suitable for this purpose . a new category of medical images termed ' surgeon defined anatomy ' has been developed that exclusively relies upon the usage of navigation technology . points on the anatomy are digitized interactively by the surgeon and are used to build up an abstract geometrical model of the bony structures to be operated on . this technique may be used when no other image data is available or appropriate for a given application

a survey of interactive mesh cutting techniques and a new method for . <eos> in our experience , mesh cutting methods can be distinguished by how their solutions address the following major issues definition of the cut path , primitive removal and re meshing , number of new primitives created , when re meshing is performed , and representation of the cutting tool . many researchers have developed schemes for interactive mesh cutting with the goals of reducing the number of new primitives created , creating new primitives with good aspect ratios , avoiding a disconnected mesh structure between primitives in the cut path , and representing the path traversed by the tool as accurately as possible . the goal of this paper is to explain how , by using a very simple framework , one can build a generalized cutting scheme . this method allows for any arbitrary cut to be made within a virtual object , and can simulate cutting surface , layered surface or tetrahedral objects using a virtual scalpel , scissors , or loop cautery tool . this method has been implemented in a real time , haptic rate surgical simulation system allowing arbitrary cuts to be made on high resolution patient specific models

scale invariant segmentation of dynamic contrast enhanced perfusion mr images . <eos> selection of the best set of scales is problematic when developing signal driven approaches for pixel based image segmentation . often , different possibly conflicting criteria need to be fulfilled in order to obtain the best trade off between uncertainty ( variance ) and location accuracy . the optimal set of scales depends on several factors the noise level present in the image material , the prior distribution of the different types of segments , the class conditional distributions associated with each type of segment as well as the actual size of the ( connected ) segments . we analyse , theoretically and through experiments , the possibility of using the overall and class conditional error rates as criteria for selecting the optimal sampling of the linear and morphological scale spaces . it is shown that the overall error rate is optimized by taking the prior class distribution in the image material into account . however , a uniform ( ignorant ) prior distribution ensures constant class conditional error rates . consequently , we advocate for a uniform prior class distribution when an uncommitted , scale invariant segmentation approach is desired . experiments with a neural net classifier developed for segmentation of dynamic magnetic resonance ( mr ) images , acquired with a paramagnetic tracer , support the theoretical results . furthermore , the experiments show that the addition of spatial features to the classifier , extracted from the linear or morphological scale spaces , improves the segmentation result compared to a signal driven approach based solely on the dynamic mr signal . the segmentation results obtained from the two types of features are compared using two novel quality measures that characterize spatial properties of labelled images

adaptive filtering for noise reduction in hue saturation intensity color space . <eos> in color image processing and analysis , the conversion formulas from the rgb color model to hsi are nonlinear and complicated in comparison with the conversion formulas of other color models . when an rgb image is degraded by random gaussian noise , this nonlinearity leads to a nonuniform noise distribution in hsi , making accurate image analysis more difficult . we have analyzed the noise characteristics of the hsi color model and developed an adaptive spatial filtering method to reduce the magnitude of noise and the nonuniformity of noise variance in the hsi color space . with this adaptive filtering method , the filter kernel for each pixel is dynamically adjusted , depending on the values of intensity and saturation . in our experiments we have filtered the saturation and hue components and generated edge maps from color gradients . we have found that by using the adaptive filtering method , the minimum error rate in edge detection improves by approximately <digit> %

effective moving cast shadow detection for monocular color traffic image . <eos> for an accurate scene analysis using monocular color traffic image sequences , a robust segmentation of moving vehicles from the stationary background is generally required . however , the presence of moving cast shadow may lead to an inaccurate vehicle segmentation , and as a result , may lead to further erroneous scene analysis . we propose an effective method for the detection of moving cast shadow . by observing the characteristics of cast shadow in the luminance , chrominance , gradient density , and geometry domains , a combined probability map , called a shadow confidence score ( scs ) , is obtained . from the edge map of the input image , each edge pixel is examined to determine whether it belongs to the vehicle region based on its neighboring scss . the cast shadow is identified as those regions with high scss , which are outside the convex hull of the selected vehicle edge pixels . the proposed method is tested on <digit> vehicle images taken under different lighting conditions ( sunny and cloudy ) , viewing angles ( roadside and overhead ) , vehicle sizes ( small , medium , and large ) , and colors ( similar to the road and not ) . the results indicate that an average error rate of around <digit> % is obtained while the lowest error rate is around <digit> % for large vehicles

restoration of broadband imagery steered with a liquid crystal optical phased . <eos> in many imaging applications , it is highly desirable to replace mechanical beam steering components ( i . e . , mirrors and gimbals ) with a nonmechanical device . one such device is a nematic liquid crystal optical phased array ( lcopa ) . an lcopa can implement a blazed phase grating to steer the incident light . however , when a phase grating is used in a broadband imaging system , two adverse effects can occur . first , dispersion will cause different incident wavelengths arriving at the same angle to be steered to different output angles , causing chromatic aberrations in the image plane . second , the device will steer energy not only to the first diffraction order , but to others as well . this multiple order effect results in multiple copies of the scene appearing in the image plane . we describe a digital image restoration technique designed to overcome these degradations . the proposed postprocessing technique is based on a wiener deconvolution filter . the technique , however , is applicable only to scenes containing objects with approximately constant reflectivities over the spectral region of interest . experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique

diffraction limit for a circular mask with a periodic rectangular apertures . <eos> a mask with periodic apertures imaging system is adopted very widely and plays a leading role in modern technology for uses such as pinhole cameras , coded imaging systems , optical information processing , etc . because of its high resolution , its infinite depth of focus , and its usefulness over a broad frequency spectra ranging from visible light to x rays and gamma rays . while the masks with periodic apertures investigated in the literature are limited only to far field diffraction , they do not take the shift of apertures within the mask into consideration . therefore the derivation of the far field diffraction for a single aperture can not be applied to a mask with periodic apertures . the far field diffraction formula modified for a multiaperture mask has been proposed in the past , the analysis remains too complicated to offer some practical guidance for mask design . we study a circular mask with periodic rectangular apertures and develop an easier way to interpret it . first , the near field diffraction intensity of a circular aperture is calculated by means of lommel ' s function . then the convolution of the circular mask diffraction with periodic rectangular apertures is put together , and we can present a simple mathematical tool to analyze the mask properties including the intensity distribution , blurring aberration , and the criterion of defining the far or near field diffraction . this concept can also be expanded to analyze different types of masks with the arbitrarily shaped apertures
binocular model for figure ground segmentation in translucent and occluding . <eos> a fourier based solution to the problem of figure ground segmentation in short baseline binocular image pairs is presented . each image is modeled as an additive composite of two component images that exhibit a spatial shift due to the binocular parallax . the segmentation is accomplished by decoupling each fourier component in one of the resultant additive images into its two constituent phasors , allocating each to its appropriate object specific spectrum , and then reconstructing the foreground and background using the inverse fourier transform . it is shown that the foreground and background shifts can be computed from the differences of the magnitudes and phases of the fourier transform of the binocular image pair . while the model is based on translucent objects , it also works with occluding objects
multispectral color image capture using a liquid crystal tunable filter . <eos> system consisting of a professional monochrome ccd camera and a tunable filter in which the spectral transmittance can be controlled electronically . we perform a spectral characterization of the acquisition system taking into account the acquisition noise . to convert the camera output signals to device independent color data , two main approaches are proposed and evaluated . one consists in applying regression methods to convert from the k camera outputs to a device independent color space such as ciexyz or cielab . another method is based on a spectral model of the acquisition system . by inverting the model using a principal eigenvector approach , we estimate the spectral reflectance of each pixel of the imaged surface
iterative regularized least mean mixed norm image restoration . <eos> various types of noise . a mixed norm functional is introduced , which combines the least mean square ( lms ) and the least mean fourth ( lmf ) functionals , as well as a smoothing functional . two regularization parameters are introduced one to determine the relative importance of the lms and lmf functionals , which is a function of the kurtosis , and another to determine the relative importance of the smoothing functional . the two parameters are chosen in such a way that the proposed functional is convex , so that a unique minimizer exists . an iterative algorithm is utilized for obtaining the solution , and its convergence is analyzed . the novelty of the proposed algorithm is that no knowledge of the noise distribution is required , and the relative contributions of the lms , the lmf , and the smoothing functionals are adjusted based on the partially restored image . experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm

centroid detection based on optical correlation . <eos> centroids of multiple objects in an input scene . the first method is based on the modulus of the moment function , the second method is based on squaring the moment function , and the third method works with a single intensity filter . these methods are invariant to changes in the position , orientation , and scale of the object and result in good noise smoothing performance . we use spatial light modulators ( slms ) to directly implement the input of the image and filter information for the purpose of these approaches . we present results showing simulations from different approaches and provide comparisons between optical correlation and digital moment based methods . experimental results corresponding to an optical correlator using slms for the centroid detection are also presented
block truncation image bit plane coding . <eos> to its simple and fast computational burden . the bit rate is fixed to <digit> . <digit> bits pixel , whose performance is moderate in terms of compression ratio compared to other compression schemes such as discrete cosine transform ( dct ) , vector quantization ( vq ) , wavelet transform coding ( wtc ) , etc . two kinds of overheads are required for btc coding bit plane and quantization values , respectively . a new technique is presented to reduce the bit plane overhead . conventional bit plane overhead is <digit> . <digit> bits pixel we decrease it to <digit> . <digit> bits pixel while maintaining the same decoded quality as absolute moment btc ( ambtc ) does for the lena image . compared to other published bit plane coding strategies , the proposed method outperforms all of the existing methods
plenoptic image editing . <eos> designed to maintain consistency between multiple images of a physical 3d scene . the distinguishing feature of these operations is that edits to any one image propagate automatically to all other images as if the ( unknown ) 3d scene had itself been modified . the modified scene can then be viewed interactively from any other camera viewpoint and under different scene illuminations . the approach is useful first as a power assist that enables a user to quickly modify many images by editing just a few , and second as a means for constructing and editing image based scene representations by manipulating a set of photographs . the approach works by extending operations like image painting , scissoring , and morphing so that they alter a scene ' s plenoptic function in a physically consistent way , thereby affecting scene appearance from all viewpoints simultaneously . a key element in realizing these operations is a new volumetric decomposition technique for reconstructing an scene ' s plenoptic function from an incomplete set of camera viewpoints

optical encoding of color three dimensional correlation . <eos> distribution as the third dimension , has been shown to be useful for color pattern recognition tasks . nevertheless , 3d correlation can not be directly performed on an optical correlator , that can only process two dimensional ( 2d ) signals . we propose a method to encode 3d functions onto 2d ones in such a way that the fourier transform and correlation of these signals , that can be optically performed , encode the 3d fourier transform and correlation of the 3d signals . the theory for the encoding is given and experimental results obtained in an optical correlator are shown
search for efficient solutions of multi criterion problems by target level . <eos> the target level method is considered for solving continuous multi criterion maximization problems . in the first step , the decision maker specifies a target level point ( the desired criterion values ) then in the set of vector evaluations we seek points that are closest to the target point in the chebyshev metric . the vector evaluations obtained in this way are in general weakly efficient . to identify the efficient evaluations , the second step maximizes the sum of the criteria on the set generated in step <digit> . we prove the relationship between the evaluations and decisions obtained by the proposed procedure , on the one hand , and the efficient ( weakly efficient ) evaluations and decisions , on the other hand . if the edgeworth pareto hull of the set of vector evaluations is convex , the set of efficient vector evaluations can be approximated by the proposed method

choice from a three element set some lessons of the <digit> presidential campaign . <eos> we consider the behavior of four choice rules plurality voting , approval voting , borda count , and self consistent choice when applied to choose the best option from a three element set . it is assumed that the two main options are preferred by a large majority of the voters , while the third option gets a very small number of votes and influences the election outcome only when the two main options receive a close number of votes . when used to rate the main options , borda count and self consistent choice contain terms that allow both for the strength of preferences of the voters and the rating of the main candidates by voters who vote for the third option . in this way , it becomes possible to determine more reliably the winner when plurality voting or approval voting produce close results

self calibration from image derivatives . <eos> from image motion fields induced by a rigidly moving camera with unknown parameters , where the image formation is modeled with a linear pinhole camera model . the equations obtained show the flow to be separated into a component due to the translation and the calibration parameters and a component due to the rotation and the calibration parameters . a set of parameters encoding the latter component is linearly related to the flow , and from these parameters the calibration can be determined . however , as for discrete motion , in general it is not possible to decouple image measurements obtained from only two frames into translational and rotational components . geometrically , the ambiguity takes the form of a part of the rotational component being parallel to the translational component , and thus the scene can be reconstructed only up to a projective transformation . in general , for full calibration at least four successive image frames are necessary , with the 3d rotation changing between the measurements . the geometric analysis gives rise to a direct self calibration method that avoids computation of optical flow or point correspondences and uses only normal flow measurements . new constraints on the smoothness of the surfaces in view are formulated to relate structure and motion directly to image derivatives , and on the basis of these constraints the transformation of the viewing geometry between consecutive images is estimated . the calibration parameters are then estimated from the rotational components of several flow fields . as the proposed technique neither requires a special set up nor needs exact correspondence it is potentially useful for the calibration of active vision systems which have to acquire knowledge about their intrinsic parameters while they perform other tasks , or as a tool for analyzing image sequences in large video databases

limits for computational electromagnetics codes imposed by computer . <eos> the algorithmic complexity of the innermost loops that determine the complexity of algorithms in computational electromagnetics ( cem ) codes are analyzed according to their operation count and the impact of the underlying computer hardware . as memory chips are much slower than arithmetic processors , codes that involve a high data movement compared to the number of arithmetic operations are executed comparatively slower . hence , matrix matrix multiplications are much faster than matrix vector multiplications . it is seen that it is not sufficient to compare only the complexity , but also the actual performance of algorithms to judge on faster execution . implications involve fdtd loops , lu factorizations , and iterative solvers for dense matrices . run times on two reference platforms , namely an athlon <digit> mhz and an hp pa <digit> processor , verify the findings

teaching management science with spreadsheets from decision models to decision . <eos> the 1990s were a decade of enormous change for management science ( ms ) educators . while the outlook at the beginning of the decade was somewhat bleak , the renaissance in ms education brought about by the use of spreadsheets as the primary delivery vehicle for quantitative modeling techniques has resulted in a much brighter future . this paper takes inventory of the current state of ms education and suggests some promising new directions in the area of decision support systems for ms educators to consider for the future
teaching modeling in management science . <eos> students in mba or similar programs who will be , at best , part time practitioners of these arts . i take as a working hypothesis the radical proposition that the heart of management science itself is not the impressive array of tools that have been built up over the years ( optimization , simulation , decision analysis , queuing , and so on ) but rather the art of reasoning logically with formal models . i believe it is necessary with this group of students to teach basic modeling skills , and in fact it is only when such students have these basic skills as a foundation that they are prepared to acquire the more sophisticated skills needed to employ management science . in this paper i present a hierarchy of modeling skills , from numeracy skills through sophisticated management science skills , as a framework within which to plan courses for the occasional practitioner
causes of the decline of the business school management science course . <eos> traditional model and algorithm based course fails to meet the needs of mba programs and students . poor student mathematical preparation is a reality , and is not an acceptable justification for poor teaching outcomes . management science ph . d . s are often poorly prepared to teach in a general management program , having more experience and interest in algorithms than management . the management science profession as a whole has focused its attention on algorithms and a narrow subset of management problems for which they are most applicable . in contrast , mba ' s rarely encounter problems that are suitable for straightforward application of management science tools , living instead in a world where problems are ill defined , data is scarce , time is short , politics is dominant , and rational decision makers are non existent . the root cause of the profession ' s failure to address these issues seems to be ( in russell ackoff ' s words ) a habit of professional introversion that caused the profession to be uninterested in what mba ' s really do on the job and how management science can help them
gifts to a science academic librarian . <eos> universities and academic libraries . as a university ' s community and general public continue to donate materials , libraries accept donations willingly , both in kind and monetary . eight steps of gift processing are listed in the paper . positive and negative aspects of gift acceptance are discussed . gifts bring value for academic libraries . gifts can be considered additional routes to contribute to library collections without direct purchases , options to add money to the library budget , and the cement of social relationships . but , unfortunately , large donations are time consuming , labor intensive and costly to process . great amounts of staff time and processing space are two main negative aspects that cause concern and put the value of gift acceptance under consideration by librarians . some strategies in handling gifts are recommended . to be effective , academic science librarians need to approach gifts as an investment . librarians are not to be forced by moral and public notions and should be able to make professional decisions in evaluating proposed collections

a comparison of the discounted utility model and hyperbolic discounting models . <eos> whilst there is substantial evidence that hyperbolic discounting models describe intertemporal preferences for monetary outcomes better than the discounted utility ( du ) model , there is only very limited evidence in the context of health outcomes . this study elicits private and social intertemporal preferences for non fatal changes in health . specific functional forms of the du model and three hyperbolic models are fitted . the results show that the stationarity axiom is violated , and that the hyperbolic models fit the data better than the du model . intertemporal preferences for private and social decisions are found to be very similar
modeling the labor market as an evolving institution model artemis . <eos> institution . boundedly rational firms and individuals strive to decrease the cost or increase utility . the labor market is coordinated by a search process and decentralized setting of hiring standards , but intermediaries can speed up matching . the model reproduces the dynamics of the gross flows and spectacular changes in mobility patterns of some demographic groups when the oil crisis in the <digit> ' s occurred , notably the sudden decline of the integration in good jobs . the internal labor markets of large firms are shown to increase unemployment if the secondary ( temporary or bad ) jobs do not exist
the ultimate control group . <eos> classified on the basis of their control structures . this should be done in a way that can potentially be made operational . it is easy to identify the ultimate controller of a hierarchical organization , and the literature has largely focused on this case . however , many organizational structures mix hierarchy with collective choice procedures such as voting , or use circular structures under which superiors are accountable to their subordinates . the author develops some analytic machinery that can be used to map the authority structures of such organizations , and show that under mild restrictions there is a well defined ultimate control group . the results are consistent with intuitions about the nature of control in familiar economic settings

prospects for quantitative computed tomography imaging in the presence of . <eos> x ray computed tomography ( ct ) images of patients bearing metal intracavitary applicators or other metal foreign objects exhibit severe artifacts including streaks and aliasing . we have systematically evaluated via computer simulations the impact of scattered radiation , the polyenergetic spectrum , and measurement noise on the performance of three reconstruction algorithms conventional filtered backprojection ( fbp ) , deterministic iterative deblurring , and a new iterative algorithm , alternating minimization ( am ) , based on a ct detector model that includes noise , scatter , and polyenergetic spectra . contrary to the dominant view of the literature , fbp streaking artifacts are due mostly to mismatches between fbp ' s simplified model of ct detector response and the physical process of signal acquisition . artifacts on am images are significantly mitigated as this algorithm substantially reduces detector model mismatches . however , metal artifacts are reduced to acceptable levels only when prior knowledge of the metal object in the patient , including its pose , shape , and attenuation map , are used to constrain am ' s iterations . am image reconstruction , in combination with object constrained ct to estimate the pose of metal objects in the patient , is a promising approach for effectively mitigating metal artifacts and making quantitative estimation of tissue attenuation coefficients a clinical possibility
matching pet and ct scans of the head and neck area development of method and . <eos> positron emission tomography ( pet ) provides important information on tumor biology , but lacks detailed anatomical information . our aim in the present study was to develop and validate an automatic registration method for matching pet and ct scans of the head and neck . three difficulties in achieving this goal are ( <digit> ) nonrigid motions of the neck can hamper the use of automatic ridged body transformations ( <digit> ) emission scans contain too little anatomical information to apply standard image fusion methods and ( <digit> ) no objective way exists to quantify the quality of the match results . these problems are solved as follows accurate and reproducible positioning of the patient was achieved by using a radiotherapy treatment mask . the proposed method makes use of the transmission rather than the emission scan . to obtain sufficient ( anatomical ) information for matching , two bed positions for the transmission scan were included in the protocol . a mutual information based algorithm was used as a registration technique . pet and ct data were obtained in seven patients . each patient had two ct scans and one pet scan . the datasets were used to estimate the consistency by matching pet to ct sub <digit> , ct sub <digit> to ct sub <digit> , and ct sub <digit> to pet using the full circle consistency test . it was found that using our method , consistency could be obtained of <digit> mm and <digit> . <digit> degrees on average . the pet voxels used for registration were <digit> . <digit> mm , so the errors compared quite favorably with the voxel size . cropping the images ( removing the scanner bed from images ) did not improve the consistency of the algorithm . the transmission scan , however , could potentially be reduced to a single position using this approach . in conclusion , the represented algorithm and validation technique has several features that are attractive from both theoretical and practical point of view , it is a user independent , automatic validation technique for matching ct and pet scans of the head and neck , which gives the opportunity to compare different image enhancements

global stability of the attracting set of an enzyme catalysed reaction system . <eos> reaction rate on metabolite concentration taking the form of saturation kinetics . recently , it has been shown that this feature is associated with the phenomenon of loss of system coordination ( liu , <digit> ) . in this paper , we study a system of ordinary differential equations representing a branched biochemical system of enzyme mediated reactions . we show that this system can become very sensitive to changes in certain maximum enzyme activities . in particular , we show that the system exhibits three distinct responses a unique , globally stable steady state , large amplitude oscillations , and asymptotically unbounded solutions , with the transition between these states being almost instantaneous . it is shown that the appearance of large amplitude , stable limit cycles occurs due to a false bifurcation or canard explosion . the subsequent disappearance of limit cycles corresponds to the collapse of the domain of attraction of the attracting set for the system and occurs due to a global bifurcation in the flow , namely , a saddle connection . subsequently , almost all nonnegative data become unbounded under the action of the dynamical system and correspond exactly to loss of system coordination . we discuss the relevance of these results to the possible consequences of modulating such systems
a spatial rainfall simulator for crop production modeling in southern africa . <eos> set of spatial units in areas where long term meteorological records are available for a small number of sites only . the work forms part of a larger simulation model of the food system in a district of zimbabwe , which includes a crop production component for yields of maize , small grains and groundnuts . only a limited number of meteorological stations are available within or surrounding the district that have long time series of rainfall records . preliminary analysis of rainfall data for these stations suggested that intra seasonal temporal correlation was negligible , but that rainfall at any given station was correlated with rainfall at neighbouring stations . this spatial correlation structure can be modeled using a multivariate normal distribution consisting of <digit> related variables , representing dekadly rainfall in each of the <digit> wards . for each ward , log transformed rainfall for each of the <digit> dekads in the year was characterized by a mean and standard deviation , which were interpolated from surrounding meteorological stations . a covariance matrix derived from a distance measure was then used to represent the spatial correlation between wards . sets of random numbers were then drawn from this distribution to simulate rainfall across the wards in any given dekad . cross validation of estimated rainfall parameters against observed parameters for the one meteorological station within the district suggests that the interpolation process works well . the methodology developed is useful in situations where long term climatic records are scarce and where rainfall shows pronounced spatial correlation , but negligible temporal correlation

discrete output feedback sliding mode control of second order systems a moving switching line approach . <eos> designed independent of the initial conditions are known to be sensitive to parameter variations and extraneous disturbances during the reaching phase . for second order systems this drawback is eliminated by using the moving switching line technique where the switching line is initially designed to pass the initial conditions and is subsequently moved towards a predetermined switching line . in this paper , we make use of the above idea of moving switching line together with the reaching law approach to design a discrete output feedback sliding mode control . the main contributions of this work are such that we do not require to use system states as it makes use of only the output samples for designing the controller . and by using the moving switching line a low sensitivity system is obtained through shortening the reaching phase . simulation results show that the fast output sampling feedback guarantees sliding motion similar to that obtained using state feedback
when a better interface and easy navigation aren ' t enough examining the . <eos> an information architecture that allows users to easily navigate through a system and quickly recover from mistakes is often defined as a highly usable system . but usability in systems design goes beyond a good interface and efficient navigation . in this article we describe two database systems in a law enforcement agency . one system is a legacy , text based system with cumbersome navigation ( rms ) the newer system is a graphical user interface with simplified navigation ( copnet ) . it is hypothesized that law enforcement users will evaluate copnet higher than rms , but experts of the older system will evaluate it higher than others will . we conducted two user studies . one study examined what users thought of rms and copnet , and compared rms experts ' evaluations with nonexperts . we found that all users evaluated copnet as more effective , easier to use , and easier to navigate than rms , and this was especially noticeable for users who were not experts with the older system . the second , follow up study examined use behavior after copnet was deployed some time later . the findings revealed that evaluations of copnet were not associated with its use . if the newer system had a better interface and was easier to navigate than the older , legacy system , why were law enforcement personnel reluctant to switch we discuss reasons why switching to a new system is difficult , especially for those who are most adept at using the older system . implications for system design and usability are also discussed

collective action in the age of the internet mass communication and online . <eos> this article examines how the internet transforms collective action . current practices on the web bear witness to thriving collective action ranging from persuasive to confrontational , individual to collective , undertakings . even more influential than direct calls for action is the indirect mobilizing influence of the internet ' s powers of mass communication , which is boosted by an antiauthoritarian ideology on the web . theoretically , collective action through the otherwise socially isolating computer is possible because people rely on internalized group memberships and social identities to achieve social involvement . empirical evidence from an online survey among environmental activists and nonactivists confirms that online action is considered an equivalent alternative to offline action by activists and nonactivists alike . however , the internet may slightly alter the motives underlying collective action and thereby alter the nature of collective action and social movements . perhaps more fundamental is the reverse influence that successful collective action will have on the nature and function of the internet
explanations for the perpetration of and reactions to deception in a virtual . <eos> cases of identity deception on the internet are not uncommon . several cases of a revealed identity deception have been reported in the media . the authors examine a case of deception in an online community composed primarily of information technology professionals . in this case , an established community member ( df ) invented a character ( nowheremom ) whom he fell in love with and who was eventually killed in a tragic accident . when other members of the community eventually began to question nowheremom ' s actual identity , df admitted that he invented her . the discussion board was flooded with reactions to df ' s revelation . the authors propose several explanations for the perpetration of identity deception , including psychiatric illness , identity play , and expressions of true self . they also analyze the reactions of community members and propose three related explanations ( social identity , deviance , and norm violation ) to account for their reactions . it is argued that virtual communities ' reactions to such threatening events provide invaluable clues for the study of group processes on the internet
the effects of asynchronous computer mediated group interaction on group . <eos> this article reports a study undertaken to investigate some of the social psychological processes underlying computer supported group discussion in natural computer mediated contexts . based on the concept of deindividuation , it was hypothesized that personal identifiability and group identity would be important factors that affect the perceptions and behavior of members of computer mediated groups . the degree of personal identifiability and the strength of group identity were manipulated across groups of geographically dispersed computer users who took part in e mail discussions during a <digit> week period . the results do not support the association between deindividuation and uninhibited behavior cited in much previous research . instead , the data provide some support for a social identity perspective of computer mediated communication , which explains the higher levels uninhibited in identifiable computer mediated groups . however , predictions based on social identity theory regarding group polarization and group cohesion were not supported . possible explanations for this are discussed and further research is suggested to resolve these discrepancies

pane relief . robotic solutions for car windshield assembly . <eos> about how it ' s made . the idea that special manufacturing expertise might be required can hardly occur to anyone , but that ' s exactly what is needed to ensure crystal clear visibility , not to mention a perfect fit every time one is pressed into place on a car production line . comprising two thin glass sheets joined by a vinyl interlayer , windshields are assembled usually manually to very precise product and environmental specifications . to make sure this is done as perfectly as possible , the industry invests heavily in the equipment used for their fabrication . abb has now developed a robot based compact assembling system for the automatic assembly of laminated windshields that speeds up production and increases cost efficiency
shaping the future . bendwizard a tool for off line programming of robotic . <eos> setting up a robot to make metal cabinets or cases for desktop computers can be a complex operation . for instance , one expert might be required to carry out a feasibility study , and then another to actually program the robot . understandably , the need for so much expertise , and the time that ' s required , generally limits the usefulness of automation to high volume production . workshops producing parts in batches smaller than <digit> or so , or which rely heavily on semiskilled operators , are therefore often discouraged from investing in automation , and so miss out on its many advantages . what is needed is a software tool that operators without special knowledge of robotics , or with no more than rudimentary cad skills , can use . one which allows easy offline programming and simulation of the work cell on a pc
press shop . industrial it solutions for the press shop . <eos> manufacturing efficiency . the competitive advantage belongs to those who understand the new requirements and opportunities , and who commit to integrated solutions that span the value chain all the way from demand to production . abb ' s automation and it expertise and the process know how gained from its long involvement with the automotive industry , have been brought together in new , state of the art software solutions for press shops . integrated into industrial it architecture , they allow the full potential of the shops to be realized , with advantages at every step in the supply chain
real time enterprise solutions for discrete manufacturing and consumer goods . <eos> thinking of a whole host of industries in recent years . however , one outcome , the outsourcing of noncore activities , has made the production of goods from order entry to final delivery more and more complex . suppliers , subsuppliers , producers and customers are therefore busy adopting a new , more collaborative approach . this is mainly taking the form of order driven planning and scheduling of production , but it is also being steered by a need to reduce inventories and working capital as well as a desire to increase throughput and optimize production
extinction cross sections of realistic raindrops data bank established using . <eos> a new computer program is developed based on the t matrix method to generate a large number of total ( extinction ) cross sections ( tcs ) values of the realistic raindrops that are deformed due to a balance of the forces that act on a drop failing under gravity , and were described in shape by pruppacher and pitter ( <digit> ) . these data for various dimensions of the raindrops ( mean effective radius from <digit> to <digit> . <digit> mm ) , frequencies ( <digit> to <digit> ghz ) , ( horizontal and vertical ) polarizations , and temperatures ( <digit> , <digit> and <digit> degrees c ) are stored to establish a data bank . furthermore , a curve fitting technique , i . e . , interpolation of order <digit> , is implemented for the tcs values in the data bank . therefore , the interpolated tcs results can be obtained readily from the interpolation process with negligible or even null computational time and efforts . error analysis is carried out to show the high accuracy of the present analysis and applicability of the interpolation . at three operating frequencies of <digit> , <digit> . <digit> , and <digit> ghz locally used in singapore , some new tcs values are obtained from the new fast and efficient interpolation with a good accuracy
challenges and trends in discrete manufacturing . <eos> turned out <digit> cars per day . nowadays , ford ' s plant on that same site still produces <digit> cars each day but with just <digit> workers . similar stories abound in the manufacturing industries technology revolution and evolution a shift from vertical integration , better business and production practices and improved industrial relations all have changed manufacturing beyond recognition . so what are the current challenges and trends in manufacturing certainly , the relentless advance of technology will continue , as will user pressure for more customized design or improved environmental friendliness . some trends are already with us and more , as yet indiscernible , will come . but one major , fundamental shift now resounding throughout industry is the way in which information involving every single aspect of the manufacturing process is being integrated into one seamless system
on the beth properties of some intuitionistic modal logics . <eos> case , we define two different forms of the beth property for l , which are denoted by b1 and b2 in this paper we study the relation among b1 , b2 and the interpolation properties c1 and c2 . it turns out that c1 implies b1 , but contrary to the boolean case , is not equivalent to b1 . it is shown that b2 and c2 are independent , and moreover it comes out that , in contrast to classical case , there exists an extension of the intuitionistic modal logic of s sub <digit> type , that has not the property b2 . finally we give two algebraic properties , that characterize respectively b1 and b2

in search of a general enterprise model . <eos> in models to support decision making . such reluctance could be overcome if a model could be used for several purposes rather than using a traditional single perspective model . this requires the development of a general enterprise model ( gem ) , which can be applied to a wide range of problem domains with unlimited scope . current enterprise modelling frameworks only deal effectively with nondynamic modelling issues whilst dynamic modelling issues have traditionally only been addressed at the operational level . although the majority of research in this area relates to manufacturing companies , the framework for a gem must be equally applicable to service and public sector organisations . the paper identifies five key design issues that need to be considered when constructing a gem . a framework for such a gem is presented based on a plug and play methodology and demonstrated by a simple case study

absorption of long waves by nonresonant parametric microstructures . <eos> possibility of designing an active absorbing ( nonreflecting ) coating in the form of a thin layer with small scale stratification and fast time modulation of parameters . algorithms for space time modulation of the controlled layer structure are studied in detail for a one dimensional boundary value problem . these algorithms do not require wave field measurements , which eliminates the self excitation problem that is characteristic of active systems . the majority of the considered algorithms of parametric control transform the low frequency incident wave to high frequency waves of the technological band for which the waveguiding medium inside the layer is assumed to be opaque ( absorbing ) . the efficient use conditions are found for all the algorithms . it is shown that the absorbing layer can be as thin as desired with respect to the minimum spatial scale of the incident wave and ensures efficient absorption in a wide frequency interval ( starting from zero frequency ) that is bounded from above only by a finite space time resolution of the parameter control operations . the structure of a three dimensional parametric ' black coating whose efficiency is independent of the angle of incidence of an incoming wave is developed on the basis of the studied one dimensional problems . the general solution of the problem of diffraction of incident waves from such a coating is obtained . this solution is analyzed in detail for the case of a disk shaped element

library services today and tomorrow lessons from ilumina , a digital library . <eos> this article is based on the emerging experience associated with a digital library of instructional resources , ilumina , in which the contributors of resources and the users of those resources are the same an open community of instructors in science , mathematics , engineering , and technology . moreover , it is not the resources , most of which will be distributed across the internet , but metadata about the resources that is the focus of the central ilumina repository and its support services for resource contributors and users . the distributed ilumina library is a community sharing library for repurposing and adding value to potentially useful , mostly non commercial instructional resources that are typically more granular in nature than commercially developed course materials . the experience of developing ilumina is raising a range of issues that have nothing to do with the place and time characteristics of the instructional context in which ilumina instructional resources are created or used . the issues instead have their locus in the democratization of both the professional roles of librarians and the quality assurance mechanisms associated with traditional peer review

the open archives initiative realizing simple and effective digital library . <eos> the open archives initiative ( oai ) is dedicated to solving problems of digital library interoperability . its focus has been on defining simple protocols , most recently for the exchange of metadata from archives . the oai evolved out of a need to increase access to scholarly publications by supporting the creation of interoperable digital libraries . as a first step towards such interoperability , a metadata harvesting protocol was developed to support the streaming of metadata from one repository to another , ultimately to a provider of user services such as browsing , searching , or annotation . this article provides an overview of the mission , philosophy , and technical framework of the oai
content standards for electronic books the oebf publication structure and the . <eos> in the emerging world of electronic publishing how we create , distribute , and read books will be in a large part determined by an underlying framework of content standards that establishes the range of technological opportunities and constraints for publishing and reading systems . but efforts to develop content standards based on sound engineering models must skillfully negotiate competing and sometimes apparently irreconcilable objectives if they are to produce results relevant to the rapidly changing course of technology . the open ebook forum ' s publication structure , an xml based specification for electronic books , is an example of the sort of timely and innovative problem solving required for successful real world standards development . as a result of this effort , the electronic book industry will not only happen sooner and on a larger scale than it would have otherwise , but the electronic books it produces will be more functional , more interoperable , and more accessible to all readers . public interest participants have a critical role in this process
fuzzy modeling based on generalized conjunction operations . <eos> operations is proposed . first , some methods for the construction of parametric generalized conjunction operations simpler than the known parametric classes of conjunctions are considered and discussed . second , several examples of function approximation by fuzzy models , based on the tuning of the parameters of the new conjunction operations , are given and their approximation performances are compared with the approaches based on a tuning of membership functions and other approaches proposed in the literature . it is seen that the tuning of the conjunction operations can be used for obtaining fuzzy models with a sufficiently good performance when the tuning of membership functions is not possible or not desirable

support vector machines model for classification of thermal error in machine . <eos> this paper addresses a change in the concept of machine tool thermal error prediction which has been hitherto carried out by directly mapping them with the temperature of critical elements on the machine . the model developed herein using support vector machines , a powerful data training algorithm , seeks to account for the impact of specific operating conditions , in addition to temperature variation , on the effective prediction of thermal errors . several experiments were conducted to study the error pattern , which was found to change significantly with variation in operating conditions . this model attempts to classify the error based on operating conditions . once classified , the error is then predicted based on the temperature states . this paper also briefly describes the concept of the implementation of such a comprehensive model along with an on line error assessment and calibration system in a pc based open architecture controller environment , so that it could be employed in regular production for the purpose of periodic calibration of machine tools
adaptive and efficient mutual exclusion . <eos> write operations the performance of the algorithms depends only on the point contention , i . e . , the number of processes that are concurrently active during algorithm execution ( and not on n , the total number of processes ) . our algorithm has o ( k ) remote step complexity and o ( log k ) system response time , where k is the point contention . the remote step complexity is the maximal number of steps performed by a process where a wait is counted as one step . the system response time is the time interval between subsequent entries to the critical section , where one time unit is the minimal interval in which every active process performs at least one step . the space complexity of this algorithm is o ( n log n ) , where n is the range of process names . we show how to make the space complexity of our algorithm depend solely on n , while preserving the other performance measures of the algorithm
the congenial talking philosophers problem in computer networks . <eos> shared by processes of the same group , but not by processes of different groups . for example , suppose data is stored in a cd jukebox . then , when a disc is loaded for access , users that need data on the disc can concurrently access the disc , while users that need data on a different disc have to wait until the current disc is unloaded . the design issues for group mutual exclusion have been modeled as the congenial talking philosophers problem , and solutions for shared memory models have been proposed ( y . j . young , <digit> p . keane and m . moir , <digit> ) . as in ordinary mutual exclusion and many other problems in distributed systems , however , techniques developed for shared memory do not necessarily apply to message passing ( and vice versa ) . we investigate solutions for congenial talking philosophers in computer networks where processes communicate by asynchronous message passing . we first present a solution that is a straightforward adaptation from g . ricart and a . k . agrawala ' s ( <digit> ) algorithm for ordinary mutual exclusion . then we show that the simple modification suffers a severe performance degradation that could cause the system to behave as though only one process of a group can be in the critical section at a time . we then present a more efficient and highly concurrent distributed algorithm for the problem , the first such solution in computer networks
universal dynamic synchronous self stabilization . <eos> that is , a protocol that allows a distributed system to stabilize to a desired nonreactive behaviour ( as long as a protocol stabilizing to that behaviour exists ) . previous proposals required drastic increases in asymmetry and knowledge to work , whereas our protocol does not use any additional knowledge , and does not require more symmetry breaking conditions than available thus , it is also stabilizing with respect to dynamic changes in the topology . we prove an optimal quiescence time n d for a synchronous network of n processors and diameter d the protocol can be made finite state with a negligible loss in quiescence time . moreover , an optimal d <digit> protocol is given for the case of unique identifiers . as a consequence , we provide an effective proof technique that allows one to show whether self stabilization to a certain behaviour is possible under a wide range of models

identification of evolving fuzzy rule based models . <eos> proposed . er models implement a method for the noniterative update of both the rule base structure and parameters by incremental unsupervised learning . the rule base evolves by adding more informative rules than those that previously formed the model . in addition , existing rules can be replaced with new rules based on ranking using the informative potential of the data . in this way , the rule base structure is inherited and updated when new informative data become available , rather than being completely retrained . the adaptive nature of these evolving rule based models , in combination with the highly transparent and compact form of fuzzy rules , makes them a promising candidate for modeling and control of complex processes , competitive to neural networks . the approach has been tested on a benchmark problem and on an air conditioning component modeling application using data from an installation serving a real building . the results illustrate the viability and efficiency of the approach

reaching for five nines activewatch and siteseer . <eos> uptime . to attain such availability , your web site must be down no more than about five minutes per year . technologies like raid , clustering , and load balancing make this easier , but to actually track uptime , maintain auditable records , and discover patterns in failures to prevent downtime in the future , you ' ll need to set up external monitoring . because your internet connection is a key factor in measuring uptime , you must monitor your site from the internet itself , beyond your firewall . you could monitor with custom software on remote hosts , or you could use one of the two reasonably priced services available mercury interactive ' s activewatch and freshwater software ' s siteseer . ( freshwater software has been a subsidiary of mercury interactive for about a year now . ) the two services offer a slightly different mix of features and target different markets . both services offer availability and performance monitoring from several remote locations , alerts to email or pager , and periodic reports . they differ in what ' s most easily monitored , and in the way you interact with the services
accessible streaming content . <eos> article provides some tips and tactics for making your streaming media accessible . accessibility of streaming content for people with disabilities is often not part of the spec for multimedia projects , but it certainly affects your quality of service . most of the resources available on web accessibility deal with html . fortunately , rich media and streaming content developers have a growing number of experts to turn to for information and assistance . the essentials of providing accessible streaming content are simple blind and visually impaired people need audio to discern important visual detail and interface elements , while deaf and hard of hearing people need text to access sound effects and dialog . actually implementing these principles is quite a challenge , though . now due to a relatively new law in the us , known as section <digit> , dealing with accessibility issues is becoming an essential part of publishing on the web

building digital collections at the oac current strategies with a view to . <eos> providing a context for the exploration of user defined virtual collections , the article describes the history and recent development of the online archive of california ( oac ) . stating that usability and user needs are primary factors in digital resource development , issues explored include collaborations to build digital collections , reliance upon professional standards for description and encoding , system architecture , interface design , the need for user tools , and the role of archivists as interpreters in the digital environment
nuts and bolts implementing descriptive standards to enable virtual . <eos> to date , online archival information systems have relied heavily on legacy finding aids for data to encode and provide to end users , despite fairly strong indications in the archival literature that such legacy data is problematic even as a mediated access tool . archivists have only just begun to study the utility of archival descriptive data for end users in unmediated settings such as via the web . the ability of future archival information systems to respond to the expectations and needs of end users is inextricably linked to archivists getting their collective data house in order . the general international standard archival description ( isad ( g ) ) offers the profession a place from which to start extricating ourselves from the idiosyncracies of our legacy data and description practices
learning weights for the quasi weighted means . <eos> quasi linear means ) when a set of examples is given . we consider first a simple case , the learning of weights for weighted means , and then we extend the approach to the more general case of a quasi weighted mean . we consider the case of a known arbitrary generator f . the paper finishes considering the use of parametric functions that are suitable when the values to aggregate are measure values or ratio
prospecting virtual collections . <eos> digital archives . archivists and curators as archivists and curators do not construct virtual collections rather they enable virtual collections through the application of descriptive and other standards . virtual collections are constructed by end users
union outreach a pilgrim ' s progress . <eos> rejuvenation , archivists are challenged to ensure that the organizational , political , and cultural changes labor unions are experiencing are fully documented . the article examines the need for labor archivists to reach out actively to unions and the problems they face in getting their message across , not only to union leadership but also to union members . outreach by labor archivists is vital on three critical fronts the need to secure union funding in support of labor archival programs obtaining union cooperation in reviewing and amending obsolete deposit agreements and coordinating efforts with unions to save the records of closing district and local union offices . attempting to resolve these outstanding issues , labor archivists are pulled between two distinct institutional cultures ( one academic in nature , the other enmeshed in a union bureaucracy ) and often have their own labor archival programs compromised by the internal dynamics and politics inherent in administering large academic libraries and unions . if labor archivists are to be successful , they must find their collective voice within the labor movement and establish their relevancy to unions during a period of momentous change and restructuring . moreover , archivists need to give greater thought to designing and implementing outreach programs that bridge the fundamental disconnect between union bureaucracies and the rank and file , and unions and the public

the archival imagination of david bearman , revisited . <eos> david bearman as avant garde . archivist l . henry ( <digit> ) has sharply criticized bearman for being irreverent toward the archival theory and practice outlined by classical american archivist t . r . schellenberg . although bearman is sometimes credited ( and sometimes berated ) for establishing a new paradigm centered on the archival management of electronic records , his methods and strategies are intended to encompass all forms of record keeping . the article provides general observations on bearman ' s archival imagination , lists some of its components , and addresses elements of henry ' s critique . although the long lasting impact of bearman ' s imagination upon the archival profession might be questioned , it nonetheless deserves continued consideration by archivists and inclusion as a component of graduate archival education
pattern recognition strategies for molecular surfaces . ii . surface . <eos> for pt . i see ibid . , vol . <digit> , p . <digit> <digit> ( <digit> ) . fuzzy logic based algorithms for the quantitative treatment of complementarity of molecular surfaces are presented . therein , the overlapping surface patches defined in part i of this series are used . the identification of complementary surface patches can be considered as a first step for the solution of molecular docking problems . standard technologies can then be used for further optimization of the resulting complex structures . the algorithms are applied to <digit> biomolecular complexes . after the optimization with a downhill simplex method , for all these complexes one structure was found , which is in very good agreement with the experimental results
pattern recognition strategies for molecular surfaces . i . pattern generation . <eos> a new method for the characterization of molecules based on the model approach of molecular surfaces is presented . we use the topographical properties of the surface as well as the electrostatic potential , the local lipophilicity hydrophilicity , and the hydrogen bond density on the surface for characterization . the definition and the calculation method for these properties are reviewed . the surface is segmented into overlapping patches with similar molecular properties . these patches can be used to represent the characteristic local features of the molecule in a way that is beyond the atomistic resolution but can nevertheless be applied for the analysis of partial similarities of different molecules as well as for the identification of molecular complementarity in a very general sense . the patch representation can be used for different applications , which will be demonstrated in subsequent articles

a method for correlations analysis of coordinates applications for molecular . <eos> we describe a new method to analyze multiple correlations between subsets of coordinates that represent a sample . the correlation is established only between specific regions of interest at the coordinates . first , the region ( s ) of interest are selected at each molecular coordinate . next , a correlation matrix is constructed for the selected regions . the matrix is subject to further analysis , illuminating the multidimensional structural characteristics that exist in the conformational space . the method ' s abilities are demonstrated in several examples it is used to analyze the conformational space of complex molecules , it is successfully applied to compare related conformational spaces , and it is used to analyze a diverse set of protein folding trajectories
genetic algorithm guided selection variable selection and subset selection . <eos> method utilizes a simple encoding scheme which can represent both compounds and variables used to construct a qsar qspr model . a genetic algorithm is then utilized to simultaneously optimize the encoded variables that include both descriptors and compound subsets . the gas method generates multiple models each applying to a subset of the compounds . typically the subsets represent clusters with different chemotypes . also a procedure based on molecular similarity is presented to determine which model should be applied to a given test set compound . the variable selection method implemented in gas has been tested and compared using the selwood data set ( n <digit> compounds nu <digit> descriptors ) . the results showed that the method is comparable to other published methods . the subset selection method implemented in gas has been first tested using an artificial data set ( n <digit> points nu <digit> descriptor ) to examine its ability to subset data points and second applied to analyze the xlogp data set ( n <digit> compounds nu <digit> descriptors ) . the method is able to correctly identify artificial data points belonging to various subsets . the analysis of the xlogp data set shows that the subset selection method can be useful in improving a qsar qspr model when the variable selection method fails
a formal model of computing with words . <eos> are generalizations of classical automata where the knowledge about the system ' s next state is vague or uncertain . it is worth noting that like classical automata , fuzzy automata can only process strings of input symbols . therefore , such fuzzy automata are still ( abstract ) devices for computing with values , although a certain vagueness or uncertainty are involved in the process of computation . we introduce a new kind of fuzzy automata whose inputs are instead strings of fuzzy subsets of the input alphabet . these new fuzzy automata may serve as formal models of computing with words . we establish an extension principle from computing with values to computing with words . this principle indicates that computing with words can be implemented with computing with values with the price of a big amount of extra computations
using molecular equivalence numbers to visually explore structural features . <eos> a molecular equivalence number ( meqnum ) classifies a molecule with respect to a class of structural features or topological shapes such as its cyclic system or its set of functional groups . meqnums can be used to organize molecular structures into nonoverlapping , yet highly relatable classes . we illustrate the construction of some different types of meqnums and present via examples some methods of comparing diverse chemical libraries based on meqnums . in the examples we compare a library which is a random sample from the mdl drug data report ( mddr ) with a library which is a random sample from the available chemical directory ( acd ) . in our analyses , we discover some interesting features of the topological shape of a molecule and its set of functional groups that are strongly linked with compounds occurring in the mddr but not in the acd . we also illustrate the utility of molecular equivalence indices in delineating the structural domain over which an sar conclusion is valid
on the use of neural network ensembles in qsar and qspr . <eos> methods have not been widely adopted in structure activity and structure property correlation . neural networks are inherently unstable , in that small changes in the training set and or training parameters can lead to large changes in their generalization performance . recent research has shown that by capitalizing on the diversity of the individual models , ensemble techniques can minimize uncertainty and produce more stable and accurate predictors . in this work , we present a critical assessment of the most common ensemble technique known as bootstrap aggregation , or bagging , as applied to qsar and qspr . although aggregation does offer definitive advantages , we demonstrate that bagging may not be the best possible choice and that simpler techniques such as retraining with the full sample can often produce superior results . these findings are rationalized using krogh and vedelsby ' s ( <digit> ) decomposition of the generalization error into a term that measures the average generalization performance of the individual networks and a term that measures the diversity among them . for networks that are designed to resist over fitting , the benefits of aggregation are clear but not overwhelming
median partitioning a novel method for the selection of representative subsets . <eos> a method termed median partitioning ( mp ) has been developed to select diverse sets of molecules from large compound pools . unlike many other methods for subset selection , the mp approach does not depend on pairwise comparison of molecules and can therefore be applied to very large compound collections . the only time limiting step is the calculation of molecular descriptors for database compounds . mp employs arrays of property descriptors with little correlation to divide large compound pools into partitions from which representative molecules can be selected . in each of n subsequent steps , a population of molecules is divided into subpopulations above and below the median value of a property descriptor until a desired number of <digit> sup n partitions are obtained . for descriptor evaluation and selection , an entropy formulation was embedded in a genetic algorithm . mp has been applied to generate a subset of the available chemicals directory , and the results have been compared with cell based partitioning
chemical information based scaling of molecular descriptors a universal . <eos> scaling is a difficult issue for any analysis of chemical properties or molecular topology when disparate descriptors are involved . to compare properties across different data sets , a common scale must be defined . using several publicly available databases ( acd , cmc , mddr , and nci ) as a basis , we propose to define chemically meaningful scales for a number of molecular properties and topology descriptors . these chemically derived scaling functions have several advantages . first , it is possible to define chemically relevant scales , greatly simplifying similarity and diversity analyses across data sets . second , this approach provides a convenient method for setting descriptor boundaries that define chemically reasonable topology spaces . for example , descriptors can be scaled so that compounds with little potential for biological activity , bioavailability , or other drug like characteristics are easily identified as outliers . we have compiled scaling values for <digit> molecular descriptors . in addition the 10th and 90th percentile values for each descriptor have been calculated for use in outlier filtering
mtd pls a pls based variant of the mtd method . ii . mapping ligand receptor . <eos> the pls variant of the mtd method ( t . i . oprea et al . , sar qsar environ . res . <digit> , <digit> , <digit> <digit> ) was applied to a series of <digit> acetylcholinesterase hydrolysis substrates . statistically significant mtd pls models ( q sup <digit> between <digit> . <digit> and <digit> . <digit> ) are in agreement with previous mtd models , with the advantage that local contributions are understood beyond the occupancy nonoccupancy interpretation in mtd . a chemically intuitive approach further forces mtd pls coefficients to assume only negative ( or zero ) values for fragmental volume descriptors and positive ( or zero ) values for fragmental hydrophobicity descriptors . this further separates the various kinds of local interactions at each vertex of the mtd hypermolecule , making this method suitable for medicinal chemistry synthesis planning
prediction of ultraviolet spectral absorbance using quantitative . <eos> high performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) with ultraviolet ( uv ) spectrophotometric detection is a common method for analyzing reaction products in organic chemistry . this procedure would benefit from a computational model for predicting the relative response of organic molecules . models are now reported for the prediction of the integrated uv absorbance for a diverse set of organic compounds using a quantitative structure property relationship ( qspr ) approach . a seven descriptor linear correlation with a squared correlation coefficient ( r sup <digit> ) of <digit> . <digit> is reported for a data set of <digit> . compounds . using the sum of zindo oscillator strengths in the integration range as an additional descriptor allowed reduction in the number of descriptors producing a robust model for <digit> compounds with five descriptors and a squared correlation coefficient <digit> . <digit> . the descriptors used in the models are discussed with respect to the physical nature of the uv absorption process
assessment of the macrocyclic effect for the complexation of crown ethers with . <eos> the substructural molecular fragments method ( solov ' ev , v . p . varnek , a . a . wipff , g . j . chem . inf . comput . sci . <digit> , <digit> , <digit> <digit> ) was applied to assess stability constants ( logk ) of the complexes of crown ethers , polyethers , and glymes with na sup , k sup , and cs sup in methanol . one hundred forty seven computational models including different fragment sets coupled with linear or nonlinear fitting equations were applied for the data sets containing <digit> ( na sup ) , <digit> ( k sup ) , and <digit> ( cs sup ) compounds . to account for the macrocyclic effect for crown ethers , an additional cyclicity descriptor was used . predicted stability constants both for macrocyclic compounds and for their open chain analogues are in good agreement with the experimental data reported earlier and with those studied experimentally in this work . the macrocyclic effect as a function of cation and ligand is quantitatively estimated for all studied crown ethers
improving the predicting power of partial order based qsars through linear . <eos> partial order theory ( pot ) is an attractive and operationally simple method that allows ordering of compounds , based on selected structural and or electronic descriptors ( modeled order ) , or based on their end points , e . g . , solubility ( experimental order ) . if the modeled order resembles the experimental order , compounds that are not experimentally investigated can be assigned a position in the model that eventually might lead to a prediction of an end point value . however , in the application of pot in quantitative structure activity relationship modeling , only the compounds directly comparable to the noninvestigated compounds are applied . to explore the possibilities of improving the methodology , the theory is extended by application of the so called linear extensions of the model order . the study show that partial ordering combined with linear extensions appears as a promising tool providing probability distribution curves in the range of possible end point values for compounds not being experimentally investigated
novel ze isomerism descriptors derived from molecular topology and their . <eos> we introduce several series of novel ze isomerism descriptors derived directly from two dimensional molecular topology . these descriptors make use of a quantity named ze isomerism correction , which is added to the vertex degrees of atoms connected by double bonds in z and e configurations . this approach is similar to the one described previously for topological chirality descriptors ( golbraikh , a . , et al . j . chem . inf . comput . sci . <digit> , <digit> , <digit> <digit> ) . the ze isomerism descriptors include modified molecular connectivity indices , overall zagreb indices , extended connectivity , overall connectivity , and topological charge indices . they can be either real or complex numbers . mathematical properties of different subgroups of ze isomerism descriptors are discussed . these descriptors circumvent the inability of conventional topological indices to distinguish between z and e isomers . the applicability of ze isomerism descriptors to qsar analysis is demonstrated in the studies of a series of <digit> anticancer agents inhibiting tubulin polymerization
computer mediated communication and university international students . <eos> the international students and faculty members of a small southwest university being surveyed and interviewed . the data collection procedure blends qualitative and quantitative data . a strong consensus was found that supports the study ' s premise that there is an association between the use of computer mediated communication ( cmc ) and teaching and learning performance of international students . both groups believe cmc to be an effective teaching and learning tool by increasing the frequency and quality of communication between students and instructors improving language skills through increased writing and communication opportunities allowing students and instructors to stay current and to compete effectively providing alternative teaching and learning methods to increase students ' confidence in their ability to communicate effectively with peers and instructors and improving the instructors ' pedagogical focus and questioning techniques
uncertainty bounds and their use in the design of interval type <digit> fuzzy logic . <eos> we derive inner and outer bound sets for the type reduced set of an interval type <digit> fuzzy logic system ( fls ) , based on a new mathematical interpretation of the karnik mendel iterative procedure for computing the type reduced set . the bound sets can not only provide estimates about the uncertainty contained in the output of an interval type <digit> fls , but can also be used to design an interval type <digit> fls . we demonstrate , by means of a simulation experiment , that the resulting system can operate without type reduction and can achieve similar performance to one that uses type reduction . therefore , our new design method , based on the bound sets , can relieve the computation burden of an interval type <digit> fls during its operation , which makes an interval type <digit> fls useful for real time applications

loudspeaker voice coil inductance losses circuit models , parameter estimation , . <eos> when the series resistance is separated and treated as a separate element , it is shown that losses in an inductor require the ratio of the flux to mmf in the core to be frequency dependent . for small signal operation , this dependence leads to a circuit model composed of a lossless inductor and a resistor in parallel , both of which are frequency dependent . mathematical expressions for these elements are derived under the assumption that the ratio of core flux to mmf varies as omega sup n <digit> , where n is a constant . a linear regression technique is described for extracting the model parameters from measured data . experimental data are presented to justify the model for the lossy inductance of a loudspeaker voice coil . a spice example is presented to illustrate the effects of voice coil inductor losses on the frequency response of a typical driver
complexity transitions in global algorithms for sparse linear systems over . <eos> we study the computational complexity of a very basic problem , namely that of finding solutions to a very large set of random linear equations in a finite galois field modulo q . using tools from statistical mechanics we are able to identify phase transitions in the structure of the solution space and to connect them to the changes in the performance of a global algorithm , namely gaussian elimination . crossing phase boundaries produces a dramatic increase in memory and cpu requirements necessary for the algorithms . in turn , this causes the saturation of the upper bounds for the running time . we illustrate the results on the specific problem of integer factorization , which is of central interest for deciphering messages encrypted with the rsa cryptosystem

novel active noise reducing headset using earshell vibration control . <eos> varying from aviation communication to consumer audio . current anr systems use passive attenuation at high frequencies and loudspeaker based active noise control at low frequencies to achieve broadband noise reduction . this paper presents a novel anr headset in which the external noise transmitted to the user ' s ear via earshell vibration is reduced by controlling the vibration of the earshell using force actuators acting against an inertial mass or the earshell headband . model based theoretical analysis using velocity feedback control showed that current piezoelectric actuators provide sufficient force but require lower stiffness for improved low frequency performance . control simulations based on experimental data from a laboratory headset showed that good performance can potentially be achieved in practice by a robust feedback controller , while a single frequency real time control experiment verified that noise reduction can be achieved using earshell vibration control
theoretical and experimental investigations on coherence of traffic noise . <eos> high rise buildings a method for theoretically calculating the coherence between sound pressure inside a rectangular room in a high rise building and that outside the open window of the room is proposed . the traffic noise transmitted into a room is generally dominated by low frequency components , to which active noise control ( anc ) technology may find an application . however , good coherence between reference and error signals is essential for an effective noise reduction and should be checked first . based on traffic noise prediction methods , wave theory , and mode coupling theory , the results of this paper enabled one to determine the potentials and limitations of anc used to reduce such a transmission . experimental coherence results are shown for two similar , empty rectangular rooms located on the 17th and 30th floors of a <digit> floor high rise building . the calculated results with the proposed method are generally in good agreement with the experimental results and demonstrate the usefulness of the method for predicting the coherence

information architecture notes toward a new curriculum . <eos> professional practice . however , if it is to become a profession , it must develop a means of educating new information architects . lessons from other fields suggest that professional education typically evolves along a predictable path , from apprenticeships to trade schools to college and university level education . information architecture education may develop more quickly to meet the growing demands of the information society . several pedagogical approaches employed in other fields may be adopted for information architecture education , as long as the resulting curricula provide an interdisciplinary approach and balance instruction in technical and design skills with consideration of theoretical concepts . key content areas are information organization , graphic . design , computer science , user and usability studies , and communication . certain logistics must be worked out , including where information architecture studies should be housed and what kinds of degrees should be offered and at what levels . the successful information architecture curriculum will be flexible and adaptable in order to meet the changing needs of students and the marketplace
information architecture in jasist just where did we come from . <eos> has been simultaneously drawn out yet rapid . those with an eye on history are quick to point to wurman ' s <digit> use of the term architecture of information , but it has only been in the last <digit> years that ia has become the source of sufficient interest for people to label themselves professionally as information architects . the impetus for this recent emergence of ia can be traced to a historical summit , supported by asis t in may <digit> at boston . it was here that several hundred of us gathered to thrash out the questions of just what ia was and what this new field might become . at the time of the summit , invited to present a short talk on my return journey from the annual acm sigchi conference , i entered the summit expecting little and convinced that ia was nothing new . i left <digit> days later refreshed , not just by the enthusiasm of the attendees for this term but by ia ' s potential to unify the disparate perspectives and orientations of professionals from a range of disciplines . it was at this summit that the idea for the special issue took root . i proposed the idea to don kraft , hoping he would find someone else to run with it . as luck would have it , i ended up taking charge of it myself , with initial support from david blair . from the suggestion to the finished product has been the best part of <digit> years , and in that time more than <digit> volunteers reviewed over <digit> submissions
the impact of the internet on public library use an analysis of the current . <eos> the potential impact of the internet on the public ' s demand for the services and resources of public libraries is an issue of critical importance . the research reported in this article provides baseline data concerning the evolving relationship between the public ' s use of the library and its use of the internet . the authors developed a consumer model of the american adult market for information services and resources , segmented by use ( or nonuse ) of the public library and by access ( or lack of access ) to , and use ( or nonuse ) of , the internet . a national random digit dialing telephone survey collected data to estimate the size of each of six market segments , and to describe their usage choices between the public library and the internet . the analyses presented in this article provide estimates of the size and demographics of each of the market segments describe why people are currently using the public library and the internet identify the decision criteria people use in their choices of which provider to use identify areas in which libraries and the internet appear to be competing and areas in which they appear to be complementary and identify reasons why people choose not to use the public library and or the internet . the data suggest that some differentiation between the library and the internet is taking place , which may very well have an impact on consumer choices between the two . longitudinal research is necessary to fully reveal trends in these usage choices , which have implications for all types of libraries in planning and policy development
duality revisited construction of fractional frequency distributions based on . <eos> fractional frequency distributions of , for example , authors with a certain ( fractional ) number of papers are very irregular , and therefore not easy to model or to explain . the article gives a first attempt to this by as suming two simple lotka laws ( with exponent <digit> ) one for the number of authors with n papers ( total count here ) and one for the number of papers with n authors , n in n . based on an earlier made convolution model of egghe , interpreted and reworked now for discrete scores , we are able to produce theoretical fractional frequency distributions with only one parameter , which are in very close agreement with the practical ones as found in a large dataset produced earlier by rao ( <digit> ) . the article also shows that ( irregular ) fractional frequency distributions are a consequence of lotka ' s law , and are not examples of breakdowns of this famous historical law
relevance of web documents ghosts consensus method . <eos> systems is often called digital democracy . such an approach implies the utilization of the majority opinion of internet users to determine the most relevant documents for example , citation index usage for sorting of search results ( google . com ) or an enrichment of a query with terms that are asked frequently in relation with the query ' s theme . digital democracy is an effective instrument in many cases , but it has an unavoidable shortcoming , which is a matter of principle the average intellectual and cultural level of internet users is very low everyone knows what kind of information is dominant in internet query statistics . therefore , when one searches the internet by means of digital democracy systems , one gets answers that reflect an underlying assumption that the user ' s mind potential is very low , and that his cultural interests are not demanding . thus , it is more correct to use the term digital ochlocracy to refer to internet search systems with digital democracy . based on the well known mathematical mechanism of linear programming , we propose a method to solve the indicated problem

designing a screening experiment for highly reliable products . <eos> reliable products is one of the great challenges . by using a resolution iii experiment together with degradation test , tseng et al . ( <digit> ) presented a case study of improving the reliability of fluorescent lamps . however , in conducting such an experiment , they did not address the problem of how to choose the optimal settings of variables , such as sample size , inspection frequency , and termination time for each run , which are influential to the correct identification of significant factors and the experimental cost . assuming that the product ' s degradation paths satisfy wiener processes , this paper proposes a systematic approach to the aforementioned problem . first , an identification rule is proposed . next , under the constraints of a minimum probability of correct decision and a maximum probability of incorrect decision of the proposed identification rule , the optimum test plan can be obtained by minimizing the total experimental cost . an example is provided to illustrate the proposed method
analysis and efficient implementation of a linguistic fuzzy c means . <eos> vectors of fuzzy numbers as inputs . this algorithm is based on the extension principle and the decomposition theorem . it turns out that using the extension principle to extend the capability of the standard membership update equation to deal with a linguistic vector has a huge computational complexity . in order to cope with this problem , an efficient method based on fuzzy arithmetic and optimization has been developed and analyzed . we also carefully examine and prove that the algorithm behaves in a way similar to the fcm in the degenerate linguistic case . synthetic data sets and the iris data set have been used to illustrate the behavior of this linguistic version of the fcm
warranty reserves for nonstationary sales processes . <eos> warranty period , is of importance to the manufacturer . costs associated with replacement or repair of the product are usually drawn from a warranty reserve fund created by the manufacturer . considering a stochastic sales process , first and second moments ( and thereby the variance ) are derived for the manufacturer ' s total discounted warranty cost of a single sale for single component items under four different warranty policies from a manufacturer ' s point of view . these servicing strategies represent a renewable free replacement , nonrenewable free replacement , renewable pro rata , and a nonrenewable minimal repair warranty plans . the results are extended to determine the mean and variance of total discounted warranty costs for the total sales over the life cycle of the product . furthermore , using a normal approximation , warranty reserves necessary for a certain protection level , so that reserves are not completely depleted , are found . results and their managerial implications are studied through an extensive example

using netcloak to develop server side web based experiments without writing cgi . <eos> server side experiments use the web server , rather than the participant ' s browser , to handle tasks such as random assignment , eliminating inconsistencies with java and other client side applications . heretofore , experimenters wishing to create server side experiments have had to write programs to create common gateway interface ( cgi ) scripts in programming languages such as perl and c . netcloak uses simple , html like commands to create cgis . we used netcloak to implement an experiment on probability estimation . measurements of time on task and participants ' ip addresses assisted quality control . without prior training , in less than <digit> month , we were able to use netcloak to design and create a web based experiment and to help graduate students create three web based experiments of their own
open courseware and shared knowledge in higher education . <eos> developed world today maintain one , two , or several learning management systems ( lmss ) , which are courseware products that provide students and faculty with web based tools to manage course related applications . since the mid 1990s , two predominant models of web courseware management systems have emerged commercial and noncommercial . some of the commercial products available today were created in academia as noncommercial but have since become commercially encumbered . other products remain noncommercial but are struggling to survive in a world of fierce commercial competition . this article argues for an ethics of pedagogy in higher education that would be based on the guiding assumptions of the non proprietary , peer to peer , open source software movement
web based experiments controlled by javascript an example from probability . <eos> javascript programs can be used to control web experiments . this technique is illustrated by an experiment that tested the effects of advice on performance in the classic probability learning paradigm . previous research reported that people tested via the web or in the lab tended to match the probabilities of their responses to the probabilities that those responses would be reinforced . the optimal strategy , however , is to consistently choose the more frequent event probability matching produces suboptimal performance . we investigated manipulations we reasoned should improve performance . a horse race scenario in which participants predicted the winner in each of a series of races between two horses was compared with an abstract scenario used previously . ten groups of learners received different amounts of advice , including all combinations of ( <digit> ) explicit instructions concerning the optimal strategy , ( <digit> ) explicit instructions concerning a monetary sum to maximize , and ( <digit> ) accurate information concerning the probabilities of events . the results showed minimal effects of horse race versus abstract scenario . both advice concerning the optimal strategy and probability information contributed significantly to performance in the task . this paper includes a brief tutorial on javascript , explaining with simple examples how to assemble a browser based experiment
using latent semantic analysis to assess reader strategies . <eos> based on verbal protocols that utilized latent semantic analysis ( lsa ) . students were given self explanation reading training ( sert ) , which teaches strategies that facilitate self explanation during reading , such as elaboration based on world knowledge and bridging between text sentences . during a computerized version of sert practice , students read texts and typed self explanations into a computer after each sentence . the use of sert strategies during this practice was assessed by determining the extent to which students used the information in the current sentence versus the prior text or world knowledge in their self explanations . this assessment was made on the basis of human judgments and lsa . both human judgments and lsa were remarkably similar and indicated that students who were not complying with sert tended to paraphrase the text sentences , whereas students who were compliant with sert tended to explain the sentences in terms of what they knew about the world and of information provided in the prior text context . the similarity between human judgments and lsa indicates that lsa will be useful in accounting for reading strategies in a web based version of sert
personality research on the internet a comparison of web based and traditional . <eos> students , faculty , and researchers have become increasingly comfortable with the internet , and many of them are interested in using the web to collect data . few published studies have investigated the differences between web based data and data collected with more traditional methods . in order to investigate these potential differences , two important factors were crossed in this study whether the data were collected on line or not and whether the data were collected in a group setting at a fixed time or individually at a time of the respondent ' s choosing . the visions of morality scale ( shelton and mcadams , <digit> ) was used , and the participants were assigned to one of four conditions in class web survey , in class paper and pencil survey take home web survey , and take home paper and pencil survey . no significant differences in scores were found for any condition however , response rates were affected by the type of survey administered , with the take home web based instrument having the lowest response rate . therefore , researchers need to be aware that different modes of administration may affect subject attrition and may , therefore , confound investigations of other independent variables
implications of document level literacy skills for web site design . <eos> information on the web have placed a tremendous amount of information at the fingertips of millions of people . although most of this information is at least intended to be accurate , there is much that is rumor , innuendo , urban legend , and outright falsehood . this raises problems especially for students ( of all ages ) trying to do research or learn about some topic . finding accurate , credible information requires document level literacy skills , such as integration , sourcing , corroboration , and search . this paper discusses these skills and offers a list of simple ways that designers of educational web sites can help their visitors utilize these skills

a self adjusting quality of service control scheme . <eos> with the goal of optimizing the system reward as a result of servicing different priority clients with varying workload , qos and reward penalty requirements . our scheme is based on resource partitioning and designated degrade qos areas such that system resources are partitioned into priority areas each of which is reserved specifically to serve only clients in a corresponding class with no qos degradation , plus one degraded qos area into which all clients can be admitted with qos adjustment being applied only to the lowest priority clients . we show that the best partition is dictated by the workload and the reward penalty characteristics of clients in difference priority classes . the analysis results can be used by a qos manager to optimize the system total reward dynamically in response to changing workloads at run time . we demonstrate the validity of our scheme by means of simulation and comparing the proposed qos self adjusting scheme with those that do not use resource partitioning or designated degraded qos areas

model predictive control helps to regulate slow processes robust barrel . <eos> slow temperature control is a challenging control problem . the problem becomes even more challenging when multiple zones are involved , such as in barrel temperature control for extruders . often , strict closed loop performance requirements ( such as fast startup with no overshoot and maintaining tight temperature control during production ) are given for such applications . when characteristics of the system are examined , it becomes clear that a commonly used proportional plus integral plus derivative ( pid ) controller can not meet such performance specifications for this kind of system . the system either will overshoot or not maintain the temperature within the specified range during the production run . in order to achieve the required performance , a control strategy that utilizes techniques such as model predictive control , autotuning , and multiple parameter pid is formulated . this control strategy proves to be very effective in achieving the desired specifications , and is very robust

on batch constructing b sup trees algorithm and its performance evaluation . <eos> or adding a new index to an existing database since both of them should handle an enormous volume of data . in this paper , we propose an algorithm for batch constructing the b sup tree , the most widely used index structure in database systems . the main characteristic of our algorithm is to simultaneously process all the key values to be placed on each b tree page when accessing the page . this avoids the overhead due to accessing the same page multiple times , which results from applying the b tree insertion algorithm repeatedly . for performance evaluation , we have analyzed our algorithm in terms of the number of disk accesses . the results show that the number of disk accesses excluding those in the relocation process is identical to the number of pages belonging to the b sup tree . considering that the relocation process is an unavoidable preprocessing step for batch constructing of b sup trees , our algorithm requires just one disk access per b tree page , and therefore turns out to be optimal . we also present the performance tendency in relation with different parameter values via simulation . finally , we show the performance enhancement effect of our algorithm , compared with the one using repeated insertions through experiments

from a biological to a computational model for the autonomous behavior of an . <eos> endowing an autonomous system like a robot with intelligent behavior is difficult for several reasons . first , behavior is such a wide topic that a general framework paradigm of inspiration must be chosen in order to obtain a consistent model . such a framework can be , for example , biological modeling or an artificial intelligence approach . second , a general framework is not sufficient to determine a fully specified program to be implemented in a robot . many choices , tuning and tests must be carried out before obtaining a robust system . a biological model is presented , based on the definition of cortex like automata , representing elementary functions in the perceptive , motor or associative domain . these automata are connected in a network whose architecture , functioning and learning rules are described in a cortical framework . second , the computational model derived from that biological model is specified . the way units exchange and compute variables through links is explained , with reference to corresponding biological elements . it is then easier to report experiments allowing an autonomous system to learn regularities of a simple environment and to exploit them to satisfy some internal drives . even if additional biological hints can be added , this model allow us to better understand how a biological model can be implemented and how biological properties can emerge from a distributed set of units

quantitative speed control for srm drive using fuzzy adapted inverse model . <eos> drive is considered to be rather difficult and challenging owing to its highly nonlinear dynamic behavior . a speed control scheme having two degree of freedom ( 2dof ) structure is developed here to improve the speed dynamic response of an srm drive . in the proposed control scheme , the feedback controller is quantitatively designed to meet the desired regulation control requirements first . then a reference model and a command feedforward controller based on an inverse plant model are employed to yield the desired tracking response at nominal case . as the variations of system parameters and operating conditions occur , the prescribed control specifications may not be satisfied any more . to improve this , the inverse model is adaptively tuned by a fuzzy control scheme so that the model following tracking error is significantly reduced . in addition , a simple disturbance cancellation robust controller is added to improve the tracking and regulation control performances further

multiple model adaptive estimation with filter spawning . <eos> detect and estimate partial actuator failures on the vista f <digit> . the truth model is a full six degree of freedom simulation provided by calspan and general dynamics . the design models are chosen as <digit> state linearized models , including first order actuator models . actuator failures are incorporated into the truth model and design model assuming a failure to free stream . filter spawning is used to include additional filters with partial actuator failure hypotheses into the mmae bank . the spawned filters are based on varying degrees of partial failures ( in terms of effectiveness ) associated with the complete actuaton failure hypothesis with the highest conditional probability of correctness at the current time . thus , a blended estimate of the failure effectiveness is found using the filters ' estimates based upon a no failure hypothesis , a complete actuator failure hypothesis , and the spawned filters ' partial failure hypotheses . this yields substantial precision in effectiveness estimation , compared with what is possible without spawning additional filters , making partial failure adaptation a viable methodology
matched filter template generation via spatial filtering application to fetal . <eos> we have developed a two step procedure for signal processing of fetal biomagnetic recordings that removes cardiac interference and noise . first , a modified matched filter ( mf ) is applied to remove maternal cardiac interference then , a simple signal space projection ( ssp ) is applied to remove noise . the key difference between our mf and a conventional one is that the interference template and the template scaling are derived from a signal that has been spatially filtered to isolate the interference , rather than from the raw signal . unlike conventional mfs , ours is able to separate maternal and fetal cardiac complexes , even when they have similar morphology and overlap strongly . when followed by a ssp that preserves only the signal subspace , the noise is reduced to a low level

noninvasive myocardial activation time imaging a novel inverse algorithm . <eos> linear approaches like the minimum norm least square algorithm show insufficient performance when it comes to estimating the activation time map on the surface of the heart from electrocardiographic ( ecg ) mapping data . additional regularization has to be considered leading to a nonlinear problem formulation . the gauss newton approach is one of the standard mathematical tools capable of solving this kind of problem . to our experience , this algorithm has specific drawbacks which are caused by the applied regularization procedure . in particular , under clinical conditions the amount of regularization can not be determined clearly . for this reason , we have developed an iterative algorithm solving this nonlinear problem by a sequence of regularized linear problems . at each step of iteration , an individual l curve is computed . subsequent iteration steps are performed with the individual optimal regularization parameter . this novel approach is compared with the standard gauss newton approach . both methods are applied to simulated ecg mapping data as well as to single beat sinus rhythm data from two patients recorded in the catheter laboratory . the proposed approach shows excellent numerical and computational performance , even under clinical conditions at which the gauss newton approach begins to break down

automated breath detection on long duration signals using feedforward . <eos> a new breath detection algorithm is presented , intended to automate the analysis of respiratory data acquired during sleep . the algorithm is based on two independent artificial neural networks ( ann sub insp and ann sub expi ) that recognize , in the original signal , windows of interest where the onset of inspiration and expiration occurs . postprocessing consists in finding inside each of these windows of interest minimum and maximum corresponding to each inspiration and expiration . the ann sub insp and ann sub expi correctly determine respectively <digit> . <digit> % and <digit> . <digit> % of the desired windows , when compared with <digit> <digit> inspirations and <digit> <digit> expirations detected by a human expert , obtained from three entire night recordings . postprocessing allowed determination of inspiration and expiration onsets with a mean difference with respect to the same human expert of ( mean or sd ) <digit> or <digit> ms for inspiration and <digit> or <digit> ms for expiration . the method proved to be effective in detecting the onset of inspiration and expiration in full night continuous recordings . a comparison of five human experts performing the same classification task yielded that the automated algorithm was undifferentiable from these human experts , failing within the distribution of human expert results . besides being applicable to adult respiratory volume data , the presented algorithm was also successfully applied to infant sleep data , consisting of uncalibrated rib cage and abdominal movement recordings . a comparison with two previously published algorithms for breath detection in respiratory volume signal shows that the presented algorithm has a higher specificity , while presenting similar or higher positive predictive values
model selection in electromagnetic source analysis with an application to vefs . <eos> sources are required to describe the electroencephalogram or magnetoencephalogram adequately . model selection procedures ( msps ) or goodness of fit procedures give an estimate of the required number of sources . existing and new msps are evaluated in different source and noise settings two sources which are close or distant and noise which is uncorrelated or correlated . the commonly used msp residual variance is seen to be ineffective , that is it often selects too many sources . alternatives like the adjusted hotelling ' s test , bayes information criterion and the wald test on source amplitudes are seen to be effective . the adjusted hotelling ' s test is recommended if a conservative approach is taken and msps such as bayes information criterion or the wald test on source amplitudes are recommended if a more liberal approach is desirable . the msps are applied to empirical data ( visual evoked fields )
time varying properties of renal autoregulatory mechanisms . <eos> autoregulation , time frequency and time scaling methods were applied to renal blood flow under broad band forced arterial blood pressure fluctuations and single nephron renal blood flow with spontaneous oscillations obtained from normotensive ( sprague dawley , wistar , and long evans ) rats , and spontaneously hypertensive rats . time frequency analyses of normotensive and hypertensive blood flow data obtained from either the whole kidney or the single nephron show that indeed both the myogenic and tubuloglomerular feedback ( tgf ) mechanisms have time varying characteristics . furthermore , we utilized the renyi entropy to measure the complexity of blood flow dynamics in the time frequency plane in an effort to discern differences between normotensive and hypertensive recordings . we found a clear difference in renyi entropy between normotensive and hypertensive blood flow recordings at the whole kidney level for both forced ( p < <digit> . <digit> ) and spontaneous arterial pressure fluctuations ( p < <digit> . <digit> ) , and at the single nephron level ( p < <digit> . <digit> ) . especially at the single nephron level , the mean renyi entropy is significantly larger for hypertensive than normotensive rats , suggesting more complex dynamics in the hypertensive condition . to further evaluate whether or not the separation of dynamics between normotensive and hypertensive rats is found in the prescribed frequency ranges of the myogenic and tgf mechanisms , we employed multiresolution wavelet transform . our analysis revealed that exclusively over scale ranges corresponding to the frequency intervals of the myogenic and tgf mechanisms , the widths of the blood flow wavelet coefficients fall into disjoint sets for normotensive and hypertensive rats . the separation of the scales at the myogenic and tgf frequency ranges is distinct and obtained with <digit> % accuracy . however , this observation remains valid only for the whole kidney blood pressure flow data . the results suggest that understanding of the time varying properties of the two mechanisms is required for a complete description of renal autoregulation
the use of the spsa method in ecg analysis . <eos> signals recorded of a single patient over a relatively long period of time is considered . the particular application we have in mind is high resolution ecg analysis , such as late potential analysis , morphology changes in qrs during arrythmias , t wave alternants , or the study of drug effects on ventricular activation . we propose to apply a modification of a classical method of cluster analysis or vector quantization . the novelty of our approach is that we use a new distortion measure to quantify the distance of two ecg cycles , and the class distortion measure is defined using a min max criterion . the new class distortion measure is much more sensitive to outliers than the usual distortion measures using average distance . the price of this practical advantage is that computational complexity is significantly increased . the resulting nonsmooth optimization problem is solved by an adapted version of the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation ( spsa ) method of j . spall ( ieee trans . automat . contr . , vol . <digit> , p . <digit> <digit> , mar . <digit> ) . the main idea is to generate a smooth approximation by a randomization procedure . the viability of the method is demonstrated on both simulated and real data . an experimental comparison with the widely used correlation method is given on real data
model intestinal microflora in computer simulation a simulation and modeling . <eos> the ecology of the human intestinal microflora and its interaction with the host are poorly understood . though more and more data are being acquired , in part using modern molecular methods , development of a quantitative theory has not kept pace with this increase in observing power . this is in part due to the complexity of the system and to the lack of simulation environments in which to test what the ecological effect of a hypothetical mechanism of interaction would be , before resorting to laboratory experiments . the mimics project attempts to address this through the development of a cellular automaton for simulation of the intestinal microflora . in this paper , the design and evaluation of this simulator is discussed

accurate modeling of lossy nonuniform transmission lines by using differential . <eos> this paper discusses an efficient numerical approximation technique , called the differential quadrature method ( dqm ) , which has been adapted to model lossy uniform and nonuniform transmission lines . the dqm can quickly compute the derivative of a function at any point within its bounded domain by estimating a weighted linear sum of values of the function at a small set of points belonging to the domain . using the dqm , the frequency domain telegrapher ' s partial differential equations for transmission lines can be discretized into a set of easily solvable algebraic equations . dqm reduces interconnects into multiport models whose port voltages and currents are related by rational formulas in the frequency domain . although the rationalization process in dqm is comparable with the pade approximation of asymptotic waveform evaluation ( awe ) applied to transmission lines , the derivation mechanisms in these two disparate methods are significantly different . unlike awe , which employs a complex moment matching process to obtain rational approximation , the dqm requires no approximation of transcendental functions , thereby avoiding the process of moment generation and moment matching . due to global sampling of points in the dqm approximation , it requires far fewer grid points in order to build accurate discrete models than other numerical methods do . the dqm based time domain model can be readily integrated in a circuit simulator like spice

controller performance analysis with lqg benchmark obtained under closed loop . <eos> this paper proposes a new method for obtaining a linear quadratic gaussian ( lqg ) benchmark in terms of the variances of process input and output from closed loop data , for assessing the controller performance . lqg benchmark has been proposed in the literature to assess controller performance since the lqg tradeoff curve represents the limit of performance in terms of input and output variances . however , an explicit parametric model is required to calculate the lqg benchmark . in this work , we propose a data driven subspace approach to calculate the lqg benchmark under closed loop conditions with certain external excitations . the optimal lqg benchmark variances are obtained directly from the subspace matrices corresponding to the deterministic inputs and the stochastic inputs , which are identified using closed loop data with setpoint excitation . these variances are used for assessing the controller performance . the method proposed in this paper is applicable to both univariate and multivariate systems . profit analysis for the implementation of feedforward control to the existing feedback only control system is also analyzed under the optimal lqg performance framework
