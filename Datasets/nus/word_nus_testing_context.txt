<digit> source dispersers for sub polynomial entropy and ramsey graphs beating the frankl wilson construction . <eos> the main result of this paper is an explicit disperser for two independent sources on n bits , each of entropy k n explicit n n boolean matrices for which no k k sub matrix is monochromatic . viewed as adjacency matrices of bipartite graphs , this gives an explicit construction of k ramsey bipartite graphs of size n . this greatly improves the previous bound of k o ( n ) of barak , kindler , shaltiel , sudakov and wigderson <digit> . it also significantly improves the <digit> year record of k o ( n ) on the special case of ramsey graphs , due to frankl and wilson <digit> . the construction uses ( besides classical extractor ideas ) almost all of the machinery developed in the last couple of years for extraction from independent sources , including bourgain ' s extractor for <digit> independent sources of some entropy rate lt <digit> <digit> <digit> raz ' s extractor for <digit> independent sources , one of which has any entropy rate gt <digit> <digit> <digit> rao ' s extractor for <digit> independent block sources of entropy the challenge response mechanism for detecting entropy concentration of <digit> . the main novelty comes in a bootstrap procedure which allows the challenge response mechanism of <digit> to be used with sources of less and less entropy , using recursive calls to itself . subtleties arise since the success of this mechanism depends on restricting the given sources , and so recursion constantly changes the original sources . these are resolved via a new construct , in between a disperser and an extractor , which behaves like an extractor on sufficiently large subsources of the given ones . categories and subject descriptors g . <digit> . <digit> mathematics of computing discrete mathematics graph algorithms general terms theory , algorithms
a frequency based and a poisson based definition of the probability of being informative . <eos> this paper reports on theoretical investigations about the assumptions underlying the inverse document frequency ( idf ) . we show that an intuitive idf based probability function for the probability of a term being informative assumes disjoint document events . by assuming documents to be independent rather than disjoint , we arrive at a poisson based probability of being informative . the framework is useful for understanding and deciding the parameter estimation and combination in probabilistic retrieval models . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> information search and retrieval retrieval models general terms theory

impedance coupling in content targeted advertising . <eos> the current boom of the web is associated with the revenues originated from on line advertising . while search based advertising is dominant , the association of ads with a web page ( during user navigation ) is becoming increasingly important . in this work , we study the problem of associating ads with a web page , referred to as content targeted advertising , from a computer science perspective . we assume that we have access to the text of the web page , the keywords declared by an advertiser , and a text associated with the advertiser ' s business . using no other information and operating in fully automatic fashion , we propose ten strategies for solving the problem and evaluate their effectiveness . our methods indicate that a matching strategy that takes into account the semantics of the problem ( referred to as aak for ads and keywords ) can yield gains in average precision figures of <digit> % compared to a trivial vector based strategy . further , a more sophisticated impedance coupling strategy , which expands the text of the web page to reduce vocabulary impedance with regard to an advertisement , can yield extra gains in average precision of <digit> % . these are first results . they suggest that great accuracy in content targeted advertising can be attained with appropriate algorithms . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> information storage and retrieval information search and retrieval i . <digit> . <digit> pattern recognition applications text processing general terms algorithms , experimentation

implicit user modeling for personalized search . <eos> information retrieval systems ( e . g . , web search engines ) are critical for overcoming information overload . a major deficiency of existing retrieval systems is that they generally lack user modeling and are not adaptive to individual users , resulting in inherently non optimal retrieval performance . for example , a tourist and a programmer may use the same word java to search for different information , but the current search systems would return the same results . in this paper , we study how to infer a user ' s interest from the user ' s search context and use the inferred implicit user model for personalized search . we present a decision theoretic framework and develop techniques for implicit user modeling in information retrieval . we develop an intelligent client side web search agent ( ucair ) that can perform eager implicit feedback , e . g . , query expansion based on previous queries and immediate result reranking based on clickthrough information . experiments on web search show that our search agent can improve search accuracy over the popular google search engine . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> information search and retrieval retrieval models , relevance feedback , search process general terms algorithms
improvements of tlaesa nearest neighbour search algorithm and extension to approximation search . <eos> nearest neighbour ( nn ) searches and k nearest neighbour ( k nn ) searches are widely used in pattern recognition and image retrieval . an nn ( k nn ) search finds the closest object ( closest k objects ) to a query object . although the definition of the distance between objects depends on applications , its computation is generally complicated and time consuming . it is therefore important to reduce the number of distance computations . tlaesa ( tree linear approximating and eliminating search algorithm ) is one of the fastest algorithms for nn searches . this method reduces distance computations by using a branch and bound algorithm . in this paper we improve both the data structure and the search algorithm of tlaesa . the proposed method greatly reduces the number of distance computations . moreover , we extend the improved method to an approximation search algorithm which ensures the quality of solutions . experimental results show that the proposed method is efficient and finds an approximate solution with a very low error rate .

incspan incremental mining of sequential patterns in large database . <eos> many real life sequence databases grow incrementally . it is undesirable to mine sequential patterns from scratch each time when a small set of sequences grow , or when some new sequences are added into the database . incremental algorithm should be developed for sequential pattern mining so that mining can be adapted to incremental database updates . however , it is nontrivial to mine sequential patterns incrementally , especially when the existing sequences grow incrementally because such growth may lead to the generation of many new patterns due to the interactions of the growing subsequences with the original ones . in this study , we develop an efficient algorithm , incspan , for incremental mining of sequential patterns , by exploring some interesting properties . our performance study shows that incspan outperforms some previously proposed incremental algorithms as well as a non incremental one with a wide margin . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> database management database applications data mining general terms algorithms , performance , experimentation
index structures and algorithms for querying distributed rdf repositories . <eos> a technical infrastructure for storing , querying and managing rdf data is a key element in the current semantic web development . systems like jena , sesame or the ics forth rdf suite are widely used for building semantic web applications . currently , none of these systems supports the integrated querying of distributed rdf repositories . we consider this a major shortcoming since the semantic web is distributed by nature . in this paper we present an architecture for querying distributed rdf repositories by extending the existing sesame system . we discuss the implications of our architecture and propose an index structure as well as algorithms for query processing and optimization in such a distributed context . categories and subject descriptors e . <digit> data data structures distributed data structures h . <digit> . <digit> information systems database management sys tems distributed databases , query processing general terms algorithms , performance , design motivation the need for handling multiple sources of knowledge and information is quite obvious in the context of semantic web applications . first of all we have the duality of schema and information content where multiple information sources can adhere to the same schema . further , the re use , extension and combination of multiple schema files is considered to be common practice on the semantic web <digit> . despite the inherently distributed nature of the semantic web , most current rdf infrastructures ( for example <digit> ) store information locally as a single knowledge repository , i . e . , rdf models from remote sources are replicated locally and merged into a single model . distribution is virtually retained through the use of namespaces to distinguish between different models . we argue that many interesting applications on the semantic web would benefit from or even require an rdf infrastructure that supports real distribution of information sources that can be accessed from a single point . beyond the argument of conceptual adequacy , there are a number of technical reasons for real distribution in the spirit of distributed databases freshness the commonly used approach of using a local copy of a remote source suffers from the problem of changing information . directly using the remote source frees us from the need of managing change as we are always working with the original . flexibility keeping different sources separate from each other provides us with a greater flexibility concerning the addition and removal of sources . in the distributed setting , we only have to adjust the corresponding system parameters . in many cases , it will even be unavoidable to adopt a distributed architecture , for example in scenarios in which the data is not owned by the person querying it . in this case , it will often not be permitted to copy the data . more and more information providers , however , create interfaces that can be used to query the information . the same holds for cases where the information sources are too large to just create a single model containing all the information , but they still can be queried using a special interface ( musicbrainz is an example of this case ) . further , we might want to include sources that are not available in rdf , but that can be wrapped to produce query results in rdf format . a typical example is the use of a free text index as one source of information . sometimes there is not even a fixed model that could be stored in rdf , because the result of a query is only calculated at runtime ( google , for instance , provides a programming interface that could be wrapped into an rdf source ) . in all these scenarios , we are forced to access external information sources from an rdf infrastructure without being able to create a local copy of the information we want to query . on the semantic web , we almost always want to combine such external sources with each other and with additional schema knowledge . this confirms the need to consider an rdf infrastructure that deals with information sources that are actually distributed across different locations . in this paper , we address the problem of integrated access to distributed rdf repositories from a practical point of view . in particular , starting from a real life use case where we are considering a number of distributed sources that contain research results in the form of publications , we take the existing rdf storage and retrieval system sesame and describe how the architecture and the query processing methods of the system have to be extended in order to move to a distributed setting . the paper is structured as follows . in section <digit> we present an extension of the sesame architecture to multiple , distributed repositories and discuss basic assumptions and implications of the architecture . section <digit> presents source index hierarchies as suitable mechanisms to support the localization of relevant data during query processing . in section <digit> we introduce a cost model for processing queries in the distributed architecture , and show its use in optimizing query execution as a basis for the two phase optimization heuristics for join ordering . section <digit> reviews previous work on index structures for object oriented data bases . it also summarizes related work on query optimization particularly focusing on the join ordering problem . we conclude with a discussion of open problems and future work .
a functional correspondence between evaluators and abstract machines . <eos> we bridge the gap between functional evaluators and abstract machines for the calculus , using closure conversion , transformation into continuation passing style , and defunctionalization . we illustrate this approach by deriving krivine ' s abstract machine from an ordinary call by name evaluator and by deriving an ordinary call by value evaluator from felleisen et al . ' s cek machine . the first derivation is strikingly simpler than what can be found in the literature . the second one is new . together , they show that krivine ' s abstract machine and the cek machine correspond to the call by name and call by value facets of an ordinary evaluator for the calculus . we then reveal the denotational content of hannan and miller ' s cls machine and of landin ' s secd machine . we formally compare the corresponding evaluators and we illustrate some degrees of freedom in the design spaces of evaluators and of abstract machines for the calculus with computational effects . finally , we consider the categorical abstract machine and the extent to which it is more of a virtual machine than an abstract machine categories and subject descriptors d . <digit> . <digit> software programming techniques applicative ( functional ) programming d . <digit> . <digit> programming languages proces sors interpreters general terms design , languages .
indexing multi dimensional time series with support for multiple distance measures . <eos> although most time series data mining research has concentrated on providing solutions for a single distance function , in this work we motivate the need for a single index structure that can support multiple distance measures . our specific area of interest is the efficient retrieval and analysis of trajectory similarities . trajectory datasets are very common in environmental applications , mobility experiments , video surveillance and are especially important for the discovery of certain biological patterns . our primary similarity measure is based on the longest common subsequence ( lcss ) model , that offers enhanced robustness , particularly for noisy data , which are encountered very often in real world applications . however , our index is able to accommodate other distance measures as well , including the ubiquitous euclidean distance , and the increasingly popular dynamic time warping ( dtw ) . while other researchers have advocated one or other of these similarity measures , a major contribution of our work is the ability to support all these measures without the need to restructure the index . our framework guarantees no false dismissals and can also be tailored to provide much faster response time at the expense of slightly reduced precision recall . the experimental results demonstrate that our index can help speed up the computation of expensive similarity measures such as the lcss and the dtw . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> database management database applications , data mining

( reap stands for reader specific practice . ) a key component of reap is an advanced search model that can find documents satisfying a set of diverse and possibly complex lexical constraints , including a passage ' s topic , reading level ( e . g . 3rd grade ) , use of syntax ( simple vs . complex sentence structures ) , and vocabulary that is known or unknown to the student . searching is performed on a database of documents automatically gathered from the web which have been analyzed and annotated with a rich set of linguistic metadata . the web is a potentially valuable resource for providing reading material of interest to the student because of its extent , variety , and currency for popular topics .
categorizing web queries according to geographical locality . <eos> web pages ( and resources , in general ) can be characterized according to their geographical locality . for example , a web page with general information about wildflowers could be considered a global page , likely to be of interest to a ge <unk> broad audience . in contrast , a web page with listings on houses for sale in a specific city could be regarded as a local page , likely to be of interest only to an audience in a relatively narrow region . similarly , some search engine queries ( implicitly ) target global pages , while other queries are after local pages . for example , the best results for query wildflowers are probably global pages about wildflowers such as the one discussed above . however , local pages that are relevant to , say , san francisco are likely to be good matches for a query houses for sale that was issued by a san francisco resident or by somebody moving to that city . unfortunately , search engines do not analyze the geographical locality of queries and users , and hence often produce sub optimal results . thus query wildflowers might return pages that discuss wildflowers in specific u . s . states ( and not general information about wildflowers ) , while query houses for sale might return pages with real estate listings for locations other than that of interest to the person who issued the query . deciding whether an unseen query should produce mostly local or global pages without placing this burden on the search engine users is an important and challenging problem , because queries are often ambiguous or underspecify the information they are after . in this paper , we address this problem by first defining how to categorize queries according to their ( often implicit ) geographical locality . we then introduce several alternatives for automatically and efficiently categorizing queries in our scheme , using a variety of state of the art machine learning tools . we report a thorough evaluation of our classifiers using a large sample of queries from a real web search engine , and conclude by discussing how our query categorization approach can help improve query result quality . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> information storage and retrieval information search and retrieval query formulation , search process general terms algorithms , experimentation , human factors

integrating the document object model with hyperlinks for enhanced topic distillation and information extraction . <eos> topic distillation is the process of finding authoritative web pages and comprehensive hubs which reciprocally endorse each other and are relevant to a given query . hyperlink based topic distillation has been traditionally applied to a macroscopic web model where documents are nodes in a directed graph and hyperlinks are edges . macroscopic models miss valuable clues such as banners , navigation panels , and template based inclusions , which are embedded in html pages using markup tags . consequently , results of macroscopic distillation algorithms have been deteriorating in quality as web pages are becoming more complex . we propose a uniform fine grained model for the web in which pages are represented by their tag trees ( also called their document object models or doms ) and these dom trees are interconnected by ordinary hyperlinks . surprisingly , macroscopic distillation algorithms do not work in the fine grained scenario . we present a new algorithm suitable for the fine grained model . it can dis aggregate hubs into coherent regions by segmenting their <unk> . mutual endorsement between hubs and authorities involve these regions , rather than single nodes representing complete hubs . anecdotes and measurements using a <digit> query , <digit> document benchmark suite , used in earlier topic distillation research , reveal two benefits from the new algorithm distillation quality improves , and a by product of distillation is the ability to extract relevant snippets from hubs which are only partially relevant to the query .

kddcs a load balanced in network data centric storage scheme for sensor networks . <eos> we propose an in network data centric storage ( <unk> ) scheme for answering ad hoc queries in sensor networks . previously proposed in network storage ( ins ) schemes suffered from storage hot spots that are formed if either the sensors ' locations are not uniformly distributed over the coverage area , or the distribution of sensor readings is not uniform over the range of possible reading values . our k d tree based data centric storage ( kddcs ) scheme maintains the invariant that the storage of events is distributed reasonably uniformly among the sensors . kddcs is composed of a set of distributed algorithms whose running time is within a poly log factor of the diameter of the network . the number of messages any sensor has to send , as well as the bits in those messages , is poly logarithmic in the number of sensors . load balancing in kddcs is based on defining and distributively solving a theoretical problem that we call the weighted split median problem . in addition to analytical bounds on kddcs individual algorithms , we provide experimental evidence of our scheme ' s general efficiency , as well as its ability to avoid the formation of storage hot spots of various sizes , unlike all previous <unk> schemes . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> database management systems distributed databases , query processing general terms algorithms , design , experimentation , performance

learning query languages of web interfaces . <eos> this paper studies the problem of automatic acquisition of the query languages supported by a web information resource . we describe a system that automatically probes the search interface of a resource with a set of test queries and analyses the returned pages to recognize supported query operators . the automatic acquisition assumes the availability of the number of matches the resource returns for a submitted query . the match numbers are used to train a learning system and to generate classification rules that recognize the query operators supported by a provider and their syntactic encodings . these classification rules are employed during the automatic probing of new providers to determine query operators they support . we report on results of experiments with a set of real web resources .
learning spatially variant dissimilarity ( svad ) measures . <eos> clustering algorithms typically operate on a feature vector representation of the data and find clusters that are compact with respect to an assumed ( dis ) similarity measure between the data points in feature space . this makes the type of clusters identified highly dependent on the assumed similarity measure . building on recent work in this area , we formally define a class of spatially varying dissimilarity measures and propose algorithms to learn the dissimilarity measure automatically from the data . the idea is to identify clusters that are compact with respect to the unknown spatially varying dissimilarity measure . our experiments show that the proposed algorithms are more stable and achieve better accuracy on various textual data sets when compared with similar algorithms proposed in the literature . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> database management database applications data mining general terms algorithms

location based indexing scheme for days . <eos> data dissemination through wireless channels for broadcasting information to consumers is becoming quite common . many dissemination schemes have been proposed but most of them push data to wireless channels for general consumption . push based broadcast <digit> is essentially asymmetric , i . e . , the volume of data being higher from the server to the users than from the users back to the server . push based scheme requires some indexing which indicates when the data will be broadcast and its position in the broadcast . access latency and tuning time are the two main parameters which may be used to evaluate an indexing scheme . two of the important indexing schemes proposed earlier were tree based and the exponential indexing schemes . none of these schemes were able to address the requirements of location dependent data ( ldd ) which is highly desirable feature of data dissemination . in this paper , we discuss the broadcast of ldd in our project data in your space ( days ) , and propose a scheme for indexing ldd . we argue that this scheme , when applied to ldd , significantly improves performance in terms of tuning time over the above mentioned schemes . we prove our argument with the help of simulation results . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> information systems information storage and retrieval , content analysis and indexing h . <digit> . <digit> information systems information storage and retrieval , information search and retrieval . general terms algorithms , performance , experimentation
lossless online bayesian bagging . <eos> bagging frequently improves the predictive performance of a model . an online version has recently been introduced , which attempts to gain the benefits of an online algorithm while approximating regular bagging . however , regular online bagging is an approximation to its batch counterpart and so is not lossless with respect to the bagging operation . by operating under the bayesian paradigm , we introduce an online bayesian version of bagging which is exactly equivalent to the batch bayesian version , and thus when combined with a lossless learning algorithm gives a completely lossless online bagging algorithm . we also note that the bayesian formulation resolves a theoretical problem with bagging , produces less variability in its estimates , and can improve predictive performance for smaller data sets .
a machine learning based approach for table detection on the web . <eos> table is a commonly used presentation scheme , especially for describing relational information . however , table understanding remains an open problem . in this paper , we consider the problem of table detection in web documents . its potential applications include web mining , knowledge management , and web content summarization and delivery to narrow bandwidth devices . we describe a machine learning based approach to classify each given table entity as either genuine or non genuine . various features re ecting the layout as well as content characteristics of tables are studied . in order to facilitate the training and evaluation of our table classi er , we designed a novel web document table ground truthing protocol and used it to build a large table ground truth database . the database consists of <digit> , <digit> html les collected from hundreds of di erent web sites and contains <digit> , <digit> leaf lt table gt elements , out of which <digit> , <digit> are genuine tables . experiments were conducted using the cross validation method and an f measure of <digit> <digit> % was achieved . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> information systems applications communications applications information browsers general terms algorithms
low latency photon mapping using block hashing . <eos> for hardware accelerated rendering , photon mapping is especially useful for simulating caustic lighting effects on non lambertian surfaces . however , an efficient hardware algorithm for the computation of the k nearest neighbours to a sample point is required . existing algorithms are often based on recursive spatial subdivision techniques , such as kd trees . however , hardware implementation of a tree based algorithm would have a high latency , or would require a large cache to avoid this latency on average . we present a neighbourhood preserving hashing algorithm that is low latency and has sub linear access time . this algorithm is more amenable to fine scale parallelism than tree based recursive spatial subdivision , and maps well onto coherent block oriented pipelined memory access . these properties make the algorithm suitable for implementation using future programmable fragment shaders with only one stage of dependent texturing . categories and subject descriptors ( according to acm ccs ) i . <digit> . <digit> computer graphics three dimensional graphics and realism , color , shading , shadowing , and texture .
lower bounds competitive algorithms for online scheduling of unit size tasks to related machines . <eos> in this paper we study the problem of assigning unit size tasks to related machines when only limited online information is provided to each task . this is a general framework whose special cases are the classical multiple choice games for the assignment of unit size tasks to identical machines . the latter case was the subject of intensive research for the last decade . the problem is intriguing in the sense that the natural extensions of the greedy oblivious schedulers , which are known to achieve near optimal performance in the case of identical machines , are proved to perform quite poorly in the case of the related machines . in this work we present a rather surprising lower bound stating that any oblivious scheduler that assigns an arbitrary number of tasks to n related machines would need log n loglog n polls of machine loads per task , in order to achieve a constant competitive ratio versus the optimum offline assignment of the same input sequence to these machines . on the other hand , we prove that the missing information for an oblivious scheduler to perform almost optimally , is the amount of tasks to be inserted into the system . in particular , we provide an oblivious scheduler that only uses o ( loglog n ) polls , along with the additional information of the size of the input sequence , in order to achieve a constant competitive ratio vs . the optimum offline assignment . the philosophy of this scheduler is based on an interesting exploitation of the slowfit concept ( <digit> , <digit> , <digit> for a survey see <digit> , <digit> , <digit> ) for the assignment of the tasks to the related machines despite the restrictions on the provided online information , in combination with a layered induction argument for bounding the tails of the number of tasks passing from slower to faster machines . we finally use this oblivious scheduler as the core of an adaptive scheduler that does not demand the knowledge of the input sequence and yet achieves almost the same performance .

measurement of e government impact existing practices and shortcomings . <eos> public administrations of all over the world invest an enormous amount of resources in e government . how the success of e government can be measured is often not clear . e government involves many aspects of public administration ranging from introducing new technology to business process ( re ) engineering . the measurement of the effectiveness of e government is a complicated endeavor . in this paper current practices of e government measurement are evaluated . a number of limitations of current measurement instruments are identified . measurement focuses predominantly on the front ( primarily counting the number of services offered ) and not on the back office processes . interpretation of measures is difficult as all existing measurement instruments lack a framework depicting the relationships between the indicators and the use of resources . the different measures may fit the aim of the owners of the e governmental services , however , due to conflicting aims and priorities little agreement exists on a uniform set of measures , needed for comparison of e government development . traditional methods of measuring e government impact and resource usage fall short of the richness of data required for the effective evaluation of e government strategies . categories and subject descriptors j . <digit> administrative data processing administrative data processing government k . <digit> . <digit> computing milieux computers and society electronic commerce general terms management , measurement , performance , standardization

modeling and predicting personal information dissemination behavior . <eos> in this paper , we propose a new way to automatically model and predict human behavior of receiving and disseminating information by analyzing the contact and content of personal communications . a personal profile , called communitynet , is established for each individual based on a novel algorithm incorporating contact , content , and time information simultaneously . it can be used for personal social capital management . clusters of communitynets provide a view of informal networks for organization management . our new algorithm is developed based on the combination of dynamic algorithms in the social network field and the semantic content classification methods in the natural language processing and machine learning literatures . we tested communitynets on the enron email corpus and report experimental results including filtering , prediction , and recommendation capabilities . we show that the personal behavior and intention are somewhat predictable based on these models . for instance , quot to whom a person is going to send a specific email quot can be predicted by one ' s personal social network and content analysis . experimental results show the prediction accuracy of the proposed adaptive algorithm is <digit> % better than the social network based predictions , and is <digit> % better than an aggregated model based on latent dirichlet allocation with social network enhancement . two online demo systems we developed that allow interactive exploration of communitynet are also discussed . categories and subject descriptors i . <digit> . <digit> artificial intelligence learning general terms algorithms , experimentation
modeling behavioral patterns of concurrent objects using petri nets . <eos> object oriented software development practices are being rapidly adopted within increasingly complex systems , including reactive , real time and concurrent system applications . while data modeling is performed very well under current object oriented development practices , behavioral modeling necessary to capture critical information in real time , reactive , and concurrent systems is often lacking . addressing this deficiency , we offer an approach for modeling and analyzing concurrent object oriented software designs through the use of behavioral design patterns , allowing us to map stereotyped uml objects to colored petri net ( cpn ) representations in the form of reusable templates . the resulting cpns are then used to model and analyze behavioral properties of the software architecture , applying the results of the analysis to the original software design . categories and subject descriptors d . <digit> . <digit> software engineering design tools and techniques , object oriented design methods , petri nets . general terms performance , design , reliability
a new approach to intranet search based on information extraction . <eos> this paper is concerned with intranet search ' . by intranet search , we mean searching for information on an intranet within an organization . we have found that search needs on an intranet can be categorized into types , through an analysis of survey results and an analysis of search log data . the types include searching for definitions , persons , experts , and homepages . traditional information retrieval only focuses on search of relevant documents , but not on search of special types of information . we propose a new approach to intranet search in which we search for information in each of the special types , in addition to the traditional relevance search . information extraction technologies can play key roles in such kind of search by type ' approach , because we must first extract from the documents the necessary information in each type . we have developed an intranet search system called information desk ' . in the system , we try to address the most important types of search first finding term definitions , homepages of groups or topics , employees ' personal information and experts on topics . for each type of search , we use information extraction technologies to extract , fuse , and summarize information in advance . the system is in operation on the intranet of microsoft and receives accesses from about <digit> employees per month . feedbacks from users and system logs show that users consider the approach useful and the system can really help people to find information . this paper describes the architecture , features , component technologies , and evaluation results of the system . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> information storage and retrieval information search and retrieval search process i . <digit> . m document and text processing miscellaneous general terms algorithms , experimentation , human factors
modeling node compromise spread in wireless sensor networks using epidemic theory . <eos> motivated by recent surfacing viruses that can spread over the air interfaces , in this paper , we investigate the potential disastrous threat of node compromise spreading in wireless sensor networks . originating from a single infected node , we assume such a compromise can propagate to other sensor nodes via communication and preestablished mutual trust . we focus on the possible epidemic breakout of such propagations where the whole network may fall victim to the attack . based on epidemic theory , we model and analyze this spreading process and identify key factors determining potential outbreaks . in particular , we perform our study on random graphs precisely constructed according to the parameters of the network , such as distance , key sharing constrained communication and node recovery , thereby reflecting the true characteristics therein . the analytical results provide deep insights in designing potential defense strategies against this threat . furthermore , through extensive simulations , we validate our model and perform investigations on the system dynamics . index terms sensor networks , epidemiology , random key predistribution , random graph .
modelling adversaries and security objectives for routing protocols in wireless sensor networks . <eos> the literature is very broad considering routing protocols in wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) . however , security of these routing protocols has fallen beyond the scope so far . routing is a fundamental functionality in wireless networks , thus hostile interventions aiming to disrupt and degrade the routing service have a serious impact on the overall operation of the entire network . in order to analyze the security of routing protocols in a precise and rigorous way , we propose a formal framework encompassing the definition of an adversary model as well as the general definition of secure routing in sensor networks . both definitions take into account the feasible goals and capabilities of an adversary in sensor environments and the variety of sensor routing protocols . in spirit , our formal model is based on the simulation paradigm that is a successfully used technique to prove the security of various cryptographic protocols . however , we also highlight some differences between our model and other models that have been proposed for wired or wireless networks . finally , we illustrate the practical usage of our model by presenting the formal description of a simple attack against an authenticated routing protocol , which is based on the well known tinyos routing . categories and subject descriptors c . <digit> . <digit> computer systems organization computer communication networks network protocols general terms algorithms , design , security
obfuscated databases and group privacy . <eos> we investigate whether it is possible to encrypt a database and then give it away in such a form that users can still access it , but only in a restricted way . in contrast to conventional privacy mechanisms that aim to prevent any access to individual records , we aim to restrict the set of queries that can be feasibly evaluated on the encrypted database . we start with a simple form of database obfuscation which makes database records indistinguishable from lookup functions . the only feasible operation on an obfuscated record is to look up some attribute y by supplying the value of another attribute x that appears in the same record ( i . e . , someone who does not know x can not feasibly retrieve y ) . we then ( i ) generalize our construction to conjunctions of equality tests on any attributes of the database , and ( ii ) achieve a new property we call group privacy . this property ensures that it is easy to retrieve individual records or small subsets of records from the encrypted database by identifying them precisely , but mass harvesting queries matching a large number of records are computationally infeasible . our constructions are non interactive . the database is transformed in such a way that all queries except those ex <unk> allowed by the privacy policy become computationally infeasible , i . e . , our solutions do not rely on any access control software or hardware . categories and subject descriptors e . <digit> data encryption h . <digit> . <digit> database administration security , integrity , and protection general terms security
on the complexity of computing peer agreements for consistent query answering in peer to peer data integration systems . <eos> peer to peer ( p2p ) data integration systems have recently attracted significant attention for their ability to manage and share data dispersed over different peer sources . while integrating data for answering user queries , it often happens that inconsistencies arise , because some integrity constraints specified on peers ' global schemas may be violated . in these cases , we may give semantics to the inconsistent system by suitably repairing the retrieved data , as typically done in the context of traditional data integration systems . however , some specific features of p2p systems , such as peer autonomy and peer preferences ( e . g . , different source trusting ) , should be properly addressed to make the whole approach effective . in this paper , we face these issues that were only marginally considered in the literature . we first present a formal framework for reasoning about autonomous peers that exploit individual preference criteria in repairing the data . the idea is that queries should be answered over the best possible database repairs with respect to the preferences of all peers , i . e . , the states on which they are able to find an agreement . then , we investigate the computational complexity of dealing with peer agreements and of answering queries in p2p data integration systems . it turns out that considering peer preferences makes these problems only mildly harder than in traditional data integration systems . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> database management systems relational databases f . <digit> . <digit> analysis of algorithms and problem complexity nonnumerical algorithms and problems general terms theory , management
on the discovery of significant statistical quantitative rules . <eos> in this paper we study market share rules , rules that have a certain market share statistic associated with them . such rules are particularly relevant for decision making from a business perspective . motivated by market share rules , in this paper we consider statistical quantitative rules ( sq rules ) that are quantitative rules in which the rhs can be any statistic that is computed for the segment satisfying the lhs of the rule . building on prior work , we present a statistical approach for learning all significant sq rules , i . e . , sq rules for which a desired statistic lies outside a confidence interval computed for this rule . in particular we show how resampling techniques can be effectively used to learn significant rules . since our method considers the significance of a large number of rules in parallel , it is susceptible to learning a certain number of quot false quot rules . to address this , we present a technique that can determine the number of significant sq rules that can be expected by chance alone , and suggest that this number can be used to determine a quot false discovery rate quot for the learning procedure . we apply our methods to online consumer purchase data and report the results . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> database management database applications data mining . general terms algorithms , management .

performance enhancing proxy for interactive 3g network gaming . <eos> unlike non time critical applications like email and file transfer , network games demand timely data delivery to maintain the seemingly interactive presence of players in the virtual game world . yet the inherently large transmission delay mean and variance of 3g cellular links make on time game data delivery difficult . further complicating the timely game data delivery problem is the frequent packet drops at these links due to inter symbol interference , fading and shadowing at the physical layer . in this paper , we propose a proxy architecture that enhances the timeliness and reliability of data delivery of interactive games over 3g wireless networks . in particular , a performance enhancing proxy is designed to optimize a new time critical data type variable deadline data , where the utility of a datum is inversely proportional to the time required to deliver it . we show how a carefully designed and configured proxy can noticeably improve the delivery of network game data . categories and subject descriptors c . <digit> computer communication networks network architecture and design wireless communication general terms algorithms , performance , design
physically based visual simulation on graphics hardware . <eos> in this paper , we present a method for real time visual simulation of diverse dynamic phenomena using programmable graphics hardware . the simulations we implement use an extension of cellular automata known as the coupled map lattice ( cml ) . cml represents the state of a dynamic system as continuous values on a discrete lattice . in our implementation we store the lattice values in a texture , and use pixel level programming to implement simple next state computations on lattice nodes and their neighbors . we apply these computations successively to produce interactive visual simulations of convection , reaction diffusion , and boiling . we have built an interactive framework for building and experimenting with cml simulations running on graphics hardware , and have integrated them into interactive 3d graphics applications .
physiological measures of presence in stressful virtual environments . <eos> a common measure of the quality or effectiveness of a virtual environment ( ve ) is the amount of presence it evokes in users . presence is often defined as the sense of being there in a ve . there has been much debate about the best way to measure presence , and presence researchers need , and have sought , a measure that is reliable , valid , sensitive , and objective . we hypothesized that to the degree that a ve seems real , it would evoke physiological responses similar to those evoked by the corresponding real environment , and that greater presence would evoke a greater response . to examine this , we conducted three experiments , the results of which support the use of physiological reaction as a reliable , valid , sensitive , and objective presence measure . the experiments compared participants ' physiological reactions to a non threatening virtual room and their reactions to a stressful virtual height situation . we found that change in heart rate satisfied our requirements for a measure of presence , change in skin conductance did to a lesser extent , and that change in skin temperature did not . moreover , the results showed that inclusion of a passive haptic element in the ve significantly increased presence and that for presence evoked <digit> fps gt <digit> fps gt <digit> fps . categories i . <digit> . <digit> computer graphics three dimensional graphics and realism virtual reality . h . <digit> . <digit> information interfaces and presentation user interfaces , evaluation methodology . keywords presence , physiology , haptics , frame rate .

preventing attribute information leakage in automated trust negotiation . <eos> automated trust negotiation is an approach which establishes trust between strangers through the bilateral , iterative disclosure of digital credentials . sensitive credentials are protected by access control policies which may also be communicated to the other party . ideally , sensitive information should not be known by others unless its access control policy has been satisfied . however , due to bilateral information exchange , information may flow to others in a variety of forms , many of which can not be protected by access control policies alone . in particular , sensitive information may be inferred by observing negotiation participants ' behavior even when access control policies are strictly enforced . in this paper , we propose a general framework for the safety of trust negotiation systems . compared to the existing safety model , our framework focuses on the actual information gain during trust negotiation instead of the exchanged messages . thus , it directly reflects the essence of safety in sensitive information protection . based on the proposed framework , we develop policy databases as a mechanism to help prevent unauthorized information inferences during trust negotiation . we show that policy databases achieve the same protection of sensitive information as existing solutions without imposing additional complications to the interaction between negotiation participants or restricting users ' autonomy in defining their own policies . categories and subject descriptors k . <digit> . <digit> management of computing and information systems security and protection general terms security , theory

protected interactive 3d graphics via remote rendering . <eos> valuable 3d graphical models , such as high resolution digital scans of cultural heritage objects , may require protection to prevent piracy or misuse , while still allowing for interactive display and manipulation by a widespread audience . we have investigated techniques for protecting 3d graphics content , and we have developed a remote rendering system suitable for sharing archives of 3d models while protecting the 3d geometry from unauthorized extraction . the system consists of a 3d viewer client that includes low resolution versions of the 3d models , and a rendering server that renders and returns images of high resolution models according to client requests . the server implements a number of defenses to guard against 3d reconstruction attacks , such as monitoring and limiting request streams , and slightly perturbing and distorting the rendered images . we consider several possible types of reconstruction attacks on such a rendering server , and we examine how these attacks can be defended against without excessively compromising the interactive experience for non malicious users . cr categories i . <digit> . <digit> computer graphics graphics systems remote systems
providing the basis for human robot interaction a multi modal attention system for a mobile robot . <eos> in order to enable the widespread use of robots in home and office environments , systems with natural interaction capabilities have to be developed . a prerequisite for natural interaction is the robot ' s ability to automatically recognize when and how long a person ' s attention is directed towards it for communication . as in open environments several persons can be present simultaneously , the detection of the communication partner is of particular importance . in this paper we present an attention system for a mobile robot which enables the robot to shift its attention to the person of interest and to maintain attention during interaction . our approach is based on a method for multi modal person tracking which uses a pan tilt camera for face recognition , two microphones for sound source localization , and a laser range finder for leg detection . shifting of attention is realized by turning the camera into the direction of the person which is currently speaking . from the orientation of the head it is decided whether the speaker addresses the robot . the performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated with an evaluation . in addition , qualitative results from the performance of the robot at the exhibition part of the icvs ' <digit> are provided . categories and subject descriptors i . <digit> . <digit> image processing and computer vision scene analysis sensor fusion , tracking h . <digit> . <digit> models and principles user machine systems i . <digit> . <digit> pattern recognition implemen tation interactive systems general terms algorithms , performance , experimentation

publicly verifiable ownership protection for relational databases . <eos> today , watermarking techniques have been extended from the multimedia context to relational databases so as to protect the ownership of data even after the data are published or distributed . however , all existing watermarking schemes for relational databases are secret key based , thus require a secret key to be presented in proof of ownership . this means that the ownership can only be proven once to the public ( e . g . , to the court ) . after that , the secret key is known to the public and the embedded watermark can be easily destroyed by malicious users . moreover , most of the existing techniques introduce distortions to the underlying data in the watermarking process , either by modifying least significant bits or exchanging categorical values . the distortions inevitably reduce the value of the data . in this paper , we propose a watermarking scheme by which the ownership of data can be publicly proven by anyone , as many times as necessary . the proposed scheme is distortion free , thus suitable for watermarking any type of data without fear of error constraints . the proposed scheme is robust against typical database attacks including tuple attribute insertion deletion , ran dom selective value modification , data frame up , and additive attacks categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> database management systems relational databases
putting integrated information in context superimposing conceptual models with sparce . <eos> a person working with diverse information sources with possibly different formats and information models may recognize and wish to express conceptual structures that are not explicitly present in those sources . rather than replicate the portions of interest and recast them into a single , combined data source , we leave base information where it is and superimpose a conceptual model that is appropriate to the task at hand . this superimposed model can be distinct from the model ( s ) employed by the sources in the base layer . an application that superimposes a new conceptual model over diverse sources , with varying capabilities , needs to accommodate the various types of information and differing access protocols for the base information sources . the superimposed pluggable architecture for contexts and excerpts ( sparce ) defines a collection of architectural abstractions , placed between superimposed and base applications , to demarcate and revisit information elements inside base sources and provide access to content and context for elements inside these sources . sparce accommodates new base information types without altering existing superimposed applications . in this paper , we briefly introduce several superimposed applications that we have built , and describe the conceptual model each superimposes . we then focus on the use of context in superimposed applications . we describe how sparce supports context and excerpts . we demonstrate how sparce facilitates building superimposed applications by describing its use in building our two , quite diverse applications .
quality of service in ip services over bluetooth ad hoc networks . <eos> along with the development of multimedia and wireless networking technologies , mobile multimedia applications are playing more important roles in information access . quality of service ( qos ) is a critical issue in providing guaranteed service in a low bandwidth wireless environment . to provide bluetooth ip services with differentiated quality requirements , a qos centric cascading mechanism is proposed in this paper . this innovative mechanism , composed of intra piconet resource allocation , inter piconet handoff and bluetooth ip access modules , is based on the bluetooth network encapsulation protocol ( bnep ) operation scenario . from our simulations the handoff connection time for a bluetooth device is up to <digit> . <digit> s and the maximum average transmission delay is up to 4e <digit> s when seven devices join a piconet simultaneously . increasing the queue length for the bluetooth ip access system will decrease the traffic loss rate by <digit> . <digit> per <digit> ip packets at the expense of a small delay performance .
web question answering is more always better . <eos> this paper describes a question answering system that is designed to capitalize on the tremendous amount of data that is now available online . most question answering systems use a wide variety of linguistic resources . we focus instead on the redundancy available in large corpora as an important resource . we use this redundancy to simplify the query rewrites that we need to use , and to support answer mining from returned snippets . our system performs quite well given the simplicity of the techniques being utilized . experimental results show that question answering accuracy can be greatly improved by analyzing more and more matching passages . simple passage ranking and n gram extraction techniques work well in our system making it efficient to use with many backend retrieval engines . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> . content analysis and indexing , h . <digit> . <digit> information search and retrieval . general terms algorithms , experimentation .

query result ranking over e commerce web databases . <eos> to deal with the problem of too many results returned from an e commerce web database in response to a user query , this paper proposes a novel approach to rank the query results . based on the user query , we speculate how much the user cares about each attribute and assign a corresponding weight to it . then , for each tuple in the query result , each attribute value is assigned a score according to its desirableness to the user . these attribute value scores are combined according to the attribute weights to get a final ranking score for each tuple . tuples with the top ranking scores are presented to the user first . our ranking method is domain independent and requires no user feedback . experimental results demonstrate that this ranking method can effectively capture a user ' s preferences . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> information storage and retrieval online information services web based services general terms algorithms , design , experimentation , human factors .
query type classification for web document retrieval . <eos> the heterogeneous web exacerbates ir problems and short user queries make them worse . the contents of web documents are not enough to find good answer documents . link information and url information compensates for the insufficiencies of content information . however , static combination of multiple evidences may lower the retrieval performance . we need different strategies to find target documents according to a query type . we can classify user queries as three categories , the topic relevance task , the homepage finding task , and the service finding task . in this paper , a user query classification scheme is proposed . this scheme uses the difference of distribution , mutual information , the usage rate as anchor texts , and the pos information for the classification . after we classified a user query , we apply different algorithms and information for the better results . for the topic relevance task , we emphasize the content information , on the other hand , for the homepage finding task , we emphasize the link information and the url information . we could get the best performance when our proposed classification method with the okapi scoring algorithm was used . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . m information systems applications miscellaneous general terms experimentation
querying bi level information . <eos> in our research on superimposed information management , we have developed applications where information elements in the superimposed layer serve to annotate , comment , restructure , and combine selections from one or more existing documents in the base layer . base documents tend to be unstructured or semi structured ( html pages , excel spreadsheets , and so on ) with marks delimiting selections . selections in the base layer can be programmatically accessed via marks to retrieve content and context . the applications we have built to date allow creation of new marks and new superimposed elements ( that use marks ) , but they have been browse oriented and tend to expose the line between superimposed and base layers . here , we present a new access capability , called bi level queries , that allows an application or user to query over both layers as a whole . bi level queries provide an alternative style of data integration where only relevant portions of a base document are mediated ( not the whole document ) and the superimposed layer can add information not present in the base layer . we discuss our framework for superimposed information management , an initial implementation of a bi level query system with an xml query interface , and suggest mechanisms to improve scalability and performance . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> information storage and retrieval information search and retrieval information filtering , retrieval models , h . <digit> . <digit> database management heterogeneous databases . general terms management , performance , design .
ranking flows from sampled traffic . <eos> most of the theoretical work on sampling has addressed the inversion of general traffic properties such as flow size distribution , average flow size , or total number of flows . in this paper , we make a step towards understanding the impact of packet sampling on individual flow properties . we study how to detect and rank the largest flows on a link . to this end , we develop an analytical model that we validate on real traces from two networks . first we study a blind ranking method where only the number of sampled packets from each flow is known . then , we propose a new method , protocol aware ranking , where we make use of the packet sequence number ( when available in transport header ) to infer the number of non sampled packets from a flow , and hence to improve the ranking . surprisingly , our analytical and experimental results indicate that a high sampling rate ( <digit> % and even more depending on the number of top flows to be ranked ) is required for a correct blind ranking of the largest flows . the sampling rate can be reduced by an order of magnitude if one just aims at detecting these flows or by using the protocol aware method . categories and subject descriptors c . <digit> computer systems organization performance of systems measurement techniques general terms measurement , performance , experimentation this work was done while the author was visiting intel research cambridge .
ranking target objects of navigational queries . <eos> web navigation plays an important role in exploring public interconnected data sources such as life science data . a navigational query in the life science graph produces a result graph which is a layered directed acyclic graph ( dag ) . traversing the result paths in this graph reaches a target object set ( tos ) . the challenge for ranking the target objects is to provide recommendations that reflect the relative importance of the retrieved object , as well as its relevance to the specific query posed by the scientist . we present a metric layered graph pagerank ( lgpr ) to rank target objects based on the link structure of the result graph . lgpr is a modification of pagerank it avoids random jumps to respect the path structure of the result graph . we also outline a metric layered graph objectrank ( lgor ) which extends the metric objectrank to layered graphs . we then present an initial evaluation of lgpr . we perform experiments on a real world graph of life sciences objects from ncbi and report on the ranking distribution produced by lgpr . we compare lgpr with pagerank . in order to understand the characteristics of lgpr , an expert compared the top k target objects ( publications in the pubmed source ) produced by lgpr and a word based ranking method that uses text features extracted from an external source ( such as entrez gene ) to rank publications . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> information storage and retrieval on line information services , web based services h . <digit> . <digit> database management database applications , data mining general terms algorithms , experimentation

<unk> gaining insights through exploration in multimedia scientific data . <eos> an increasing amount of heterogeneous information about scientific research is becoming available on line . this potentially allows users to explore the information from multiple perspectives and derive insights and not just raw data about a topic of interest . however , most current scientific information search systems lag behind this trend being text based , they are fundamentally incapable of dealing with multimedia data . an even more important limitation is that their information environments are information centric and therefore are not suitable if insights are desired . towards this goal , in this paper , we describe the design of a system , called <unk> , which facilitates exploring multimedia scientific data to gain insights . this is accomplished by providing an interaction environment for insights where users can explore multimedia scientific information sources . the multimedia information is united around the notion of research event and can be accessed in a unified way . experiments are conducted to show how <unk> works and how it cardinally differs from other search systems . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> information interfaces and presentation user interfaces , graphical user interfaces h . <digit> . <digit> database management database applications , scientific databases h . <digit> . <digit> information storage and retrieval content analysis and indexing , indexing methods h . <digit> . <digit> information storage and retrieval information search and retrieval , query formulation , search process . general terms management , design , experimentation .

a pseudo random coordinated scheduling algorithm for bluetooth scatternets . <eos> the emergence of bluetooth as a default radio interface allows handheld devices to be rapidly interconnected into ad hoc networks . bluetooth allows large numbers of piconets to form a scatternet using designated nodes that participate in multiple piconets . a unit that participates in multiple piconets can serve as a bridge and forwards traffic between neighbouring piconets . since a bluetooth unit can transmit or receive in only one piconet at a time , a bridging unit has to share its time among the different piconets . to schedule communication with bridging nodes one must take into account their availability in the different piconets , which represents a difficult , scatternet wide coordination problem and can be an important performance bottleneck in building scatternets . in this paper we propose the pseudo random coordinated scatternet scheduling ( pcss ) algorithm to perform the scheduling of both intra and inter piconet communication . in this algorithm bluetooth nodes assign meeting points with their peers such that the sequence of meeting points follows a pseudo random process that is different for each pair of nodes . the uniqueness of the pseudo random sequence guarantees that the meeting points with different peers of the node will collide only occasionally . this removes the need for explicit information exchange between peer devices , which is a major advantage of the algorithm . the lack of explicit signaling between bluetooth nodes makes it easy to deploy the pcss algorithm in bluetooth devices , while conformance to the current bluetooth specification is also maintained . to assess the performance of the algorithm we define two reference case schedulers and perform simulations in a number of scenarios where we compare the performance of pcss to the performance of the reference schedulers .
run time dynamic linking for reprogramming wireless sensor networks . <eos> from experience with wireless sensor networks it has become apparent that dynamic reprogramming of the sensor nodes is a useful feature . the resource constraints in terms of energy , memory , and processing power make sensor network reprogramming a challenging task . many different mechanisms for reprogramming sensor nodes have been developed ranging from full image replacement to virtual machines . we have implemented an in situ run time dynamic linker and loader that use the standard elf object file format . we show that run time dynamic linking is an effective method for reprogramming even resource constrained wireless sensor nodes . to evaluate our dynamic linking mechanism we have implemented an application specific virtual machine and a java virtual machine and compare the energy cost of the different linking and execution models . we measure the energy consumption and execution time overhead on real hardware to quantify the energy costs for dynamic linking . our results suggest that while in general the overhead of a virtual machine is high , a combination of native code and virtual machine code provide good energy efficiency . dynamic run time linking can be used to update the native code , even in heterogeneous networks . categories and subject descriptors c . <digit> . <digit> computer communication networks distributed systems network operating systems general terms design , experimentation , measurement , performance

scalable data aggregation for dynamic events in sensor networks . <eos> computing and maintaining network structures for efficient data aggregation incurs high overhead for dynamic events where the set of nodes sensing an event changes with time . moreover , structured approaches are sensitive to the waiting time which is used by nodes to wait for packets from their children before forwarding the packet to the sink . although structure less approaches can address these issues , the performance does not scale well with the network size . we propose a semi structured approach that uses a structure less technique locally followed by dynamic forwarding on an implicitly constructed packet forwarding structure to support network scalability . the structure , tod , is composed of multiple shortest path trees . after performing local aggregation , nodes dynamically decide the forwarding tree based on the location of the sources . the key principle behind tod is that adjacent nodes in a graph will have low stretch in one of these trees in tod , thus resulting in early aggregation of packets . based on simulations on a <digit> nodes network and real experiments on a <digit> nodes mica2 based network , we conclude that efficient aggregation in large scale networks can be achieved by our semi structured approach . categories and subject descriptors c . <digit> . <digit> computer communication networks network architecture and design wireless communication general terms design , performance

secure hierarchical in network aggregation in sensor networks . <eos> in network aggregation is an essential primitive for performing queries on sensor network data . however , most aggregation algorithms assume that all intermediate nodes are trusted . in contrast , the standard threat model in sensor network security assumes that an attacker may control a fraction of the nodes , which may misbehave in an arbitrary ( byzantine ) manner . we present the first algorithm for provably secure hierarchical in network data aggregation . our algorithm is guaranteed to detect any manipulation of the aggregate by the adversary beyond what is achievable through direct injection of data values at compromised nodes . in other words , the adversary can never gain any advantage from misrepresenting intermediate aggregation computations . our algorithm incurs only o ( log <digit> n ) node congestion , supports arbitrary tree based aggregator topologies and retains its resistance against aggregation manipulation in the presence of arbitrary numbers of malicious nodes . the main algorithm is based on performing the sum aggregation securely by first forcing the adversary to commit to its choice of intermediate aggregation results , and then having the sensor nodes independently verify that their contributions to the aggregate are correctly incorporated . we show how to reduce secure median , count , and average to this primitive . categories and subject descriptors c . <digit> . <digit> computer communication networks general security and protection general terms security , algorithms

significance of gene ranking for classification of microarray samples . <eos> many methods for classification and gene selection with microarray data have been developed . these methods usually give a ranking of genes . evaluating the statistical significance of the gene ranking is important for understanding the results and for further biological investigations , but this question has not been well addressed for machine learning methods in existing works . here , we address this problem by formulating it in the framework of hypothesis testing and propose a solution based on resampling . the proposed r test methods convert gene ranking results into position p values to evaluate the significance of genes . the methods are tested on three real microarray data sets and three simulation data sets with support vector machines as the method of classification and gene selection . the obtained position p values help to determine the number of genes to be selected and enable scientists to analyze selection results by sophisticated multivariate methods under the same statistical inference paradigm as for simple hypothesis testing methods .
simplifying flexible isosurfaces using local geometric measures . <eos> the contour tree , an abstraction of a scalar field that encodes the nesting relationships of isosurfaces , can be used to accelerate isosurface extraction , to identify important isovalues for volume rendering transfer functions , and to guide exploratory visualization through a flexible isosurface interface . many real world data sets produce unmanageably large contour trees which require meaningful simplification . we define local geometric measures for individual contours , such as surface area and contained volume , and provide an algorithm to compute these measures in a contour tree . we then use these geometric measures to simplify the contour trees , suppressing minor topological features of the data . we combine this with a flexible isosurface interface to allow users to explore individual contours of a dataset interactively .

tcp ip performance over 3g wireless links with rate and delay variation . <eos> wireless link losses result in poor tcp throughput since losses are perceived as congestion by tcp , resulting in source throttling . in order to mitigate this effect , 3g wireless link designers have augmented their system with extensive local retransmission mechanisms . in addition , in order to increase throughput , intelligent channel state based scheduling have also been introduced . while these mechanisms have reduced the impact of losses on tcp throughput and improved the channel utilization , these gains have come at the expense of increased delay and rate variability . in this paper , we comprehensively evaluate the impact of variable rate and variable delay on long lived tcp performance . we propose a model to explain and predict tcp ' s throughput over a link with variable rate and or delay . we also propose a network based solution called ack regulator that mitigates the effect of variable rate and or delay without significantly increasing the round trip time , while improving tcp performance by up to <digit> % . categories and subject descriptors c . <digit> . <digit> network architecture and design wireless communication general terms algorithms , performance , design

the maximum entropy method for analyzing retrieval measures . <eos> we present a model , based on the maximum entropy method , for analyzing various measures of retrieval performance such as average precision , r precision , and precision at cutoffs . our methodology treats the value of such a measure as a constraint on the distribution of relevant documents in an unknown list , and the maximum entropy distribution can be determined subject to these constraints . for good measures of overall performance ( such as average precision ) , the resulting maximum entropy distributions are highly correlated with actual distributions of relevant documents in lists as demonstrated through trec data for poor measures of overall performance , the correlation is weaker . as such , the maximum entropy method can be used to quantify the overall quality of a retrieval measure . furthermore , for good measures of overall performance ( such as average precision ) , we show that the corresponding maximum entropy distributions can be used to accurately infer precision recall curves and the values of other measures of performance , and we demonstrate that the quality of these inferences far exceeds that predicted by simple retrieval measure correlation , as demonstrated through trec data . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> information storage and retrieval systems and software , performance evaluation general terms theory , measurement , experimentation
a similarity measure for motion stream segmentation and recognition . <eos> recognition of motion streams such as data streams generated by different sign languages or various captured human body motions requires a high performance similarity measure . the motion streams have multiple attributes , and motion patterns in the streams can have different lengths from those of isolated motion patterns and different attributes can have different temporal shifts and variations . to address these issues , this paper proposes a similarity measure based on singular value decomposition ( svd ) of motion matrices . eigenvector differences weighed by the corresponding eigenvalues are considered for the proposed similarity measure . experiments with general hand gestures and human motion streams show that the proposed similarity measure gives good performance for recognizing motion patterns in the motion streams in real time . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> database management database applications , data mining general terms algorithm

the potential of the cell processor for scientific computing . <eos> the slowing pace of commodity microprocessor performance improvements combined with ever increasing chip power demands has become of utmost concern to computational scientists . as a result , the high performance computing community is examining alternative architectures that address the limitations of modern cache based designs . in this work , we examine the potential of using the forthcoming sti cell processor as a building block for future high end computing systems . our work contains several novel contributions . first , we introduce a performance model for cell and apply it to several key scientific computing kernels dense matrix multiply , sparse matrix vector multiply , stencil computations , and 1d 2d ffts . the difficulty of programming cell , which requires assembly level intrinsics for the best performance , makes this model useful as an initial step in algorithm design and evaluation . next , we validate the accuracy of our model by comparing results against published hardware results , as well as our own implementations on the cell full system simulator . additionally , we compare cell performance to benchmarks run on leading superscalar ( amd opteron ) , vliw ( intel itanium2 ) , and vector ( cray x1e ) architectures . our work also explores several different mappings of the kernels and demonstrates a simple and effective programming model for cell ' s unique architecture . finally , we propose modest microarchitectural modifications that could significantly increase the efficiency of double precision calculations . overall results demonstrate the tremendous potential of the cell architecture for scientific computations in terms of both raw performance and power efficiency . categories and subject descriptors c . <digit> . <digit> processor architectures multiple data stream architectures single instruction stream , multiple data stream processors ( simd ) c . <digit> . <digit> processor architectures other architecture styles heterogeneous ( hybrid ) systems c . <digit> . <digit> processor architectures parallel architectures c . <digit> performance of systems design studies , modeling techniques , performance attributes d . <digit> . <digit> programming techniques concurrent programming parallel programming general terms performance , design
the use of mediation and ontology technologies for software component information retrieval . <eos> component based development aims at constructing software through the inter relationship between pre existing components . however , these components should be bound to a specific application domain in order to be effectively reused . reusable domain components and their related documentation are usually stored in a great variety of data sources . thus , a possible solution for accessing this information is to use a software layer that integrates different component information sources . we present a component information integration data layer , based on mediators . through mediators , domain ontology acts as a technique formalism for specifying ontological commitments or agreements between component users and providers , enabling more accurate software component information search .
through different eyes assessing multiple conceptual views for querying web services . <eos> we present enhancements for uddi daml s registries allowing cooperative discovery and selection of web services with a focus on personalization . to find the most useful service in each instance of a request , not only explicit parameters of the request have to be matched against the service offers . also user preferences or implicit assumptions of a user with respect to common knowledge in a certain domain have to be considered to improve the quality of service provisioning . in the area of web services the notion of service ontologies together with cooperative answering techniques can take a lot of this responsibility . however , without quality assessments for the relaxation of service requests and queries a personalized service discovery and selection is virtually impossible . this paper focuses on assessing the semantic meaning of query relaxation plans over multiple conceptual views of the service ontology , each one representing a soft query constraint of the user request . our focus is on the question what constitutes a minimum amount of necessary relaxation to answer each individual request in a cooperative manner . incorporating such assessments as early as possible we propose to integrate ontology based discovery directly into uddi directories or query facilities in service provisioning portals . using the quality assessments presented here , this integration promises to propel today ' s web services towards an intuitive user centered service provisioning . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> information storage and retrieval online information services , web based services . general terms algorithms , human factors , design .

topic transition detection using hierarchical hidden markov and semi markov models . <eos> in this paper we introduce a probabilistic framework to exploit hierarchy , structure sharing and duration information for topic transition detection in videos . our probabilistic detection framework is a combination of a shot classification step and a detection phase using hierarchical probabilistic models . we consider two models in this paper the extended hierarchical hidden markov model ( hhmm ) and the coxian switching hidden semi markov model ( s hsmm ) because they allow the natural decomposition of semantics in videos , including shared structures , to be modeled directly , and thus enabling efficient inference and reducing the sample complexity in learning . additionally , the s hsmm allows the duration information to be incorporated , consequently the modeling of long term dependencies in videos is enriched through both hierarchical and duration modeling . furthermore , the use of the coxian distribution in the s hsmm makes it tractable to deal with long sequences in video . our experimentation of the proposed framework on twelve educational and training videos shows that both models outperform the baseline cases ( flat hmm and hsmm ) and performances reported in earlier work in topic detection . the superior performance of the s hsmm over the hhmm verifies our belief that duration information is an important factor in video content modeling . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> information storage and retrieval content analysis and indexing . general terms algorithms , management
towards content based relevance ranking for video search . <eos> most existing web video search engines index videos by file names , urls , and surrounding texts . these types of video metadata roughly describe the whole video in an abstract level without taking the rich content , such as semantic content descriptions and speech within the video , into consideration . therefore the relevance ranking of the video search results is not satisfactory as the details of video contents are ignored . in this paper we propose a novel relevance ranking approach for web based video search using both video metadata and the rich content contained in the videos . to leverage real content into ranking , the videos are segmented into shots , which are smaller and more semantic meaningful retrievable units , and then more detailed information of video content such as semantic descriptions and speech of each shots are used to improve the retrieval and ranking performance . with video metadata and content information of shots , we developed an integrated ranking approach , which achieves improved ranking performance . we also introduce machine learning into the ranking system , and compare them with <unk> ( information retrieval model ) based method . the evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ranking methods . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> information storage and retrieval information search and retrieval search process general terms algorithms , performance , experimentation .

tracking dynamics of topic trends using a finite mixture model . <eos> in a wide range of business areas dealing with text data streams , including crm , knowledge management , and web monitoring services , it is an important issue to discover topic trends and analyze their dynamics in real time . specifically we consider the following three tasks in topic trend analysis <digit> ) topic structure identification identifying what kinds of main topics exist and how important they are , <digit> ) topic emergence detection detecting the emergence of a new topic and recognizing how it grows , <digit> ) topic characterization identifying the characteristics for each of main topics . for real topic analysis systems , we may require that these three tasks be performed in an on line fashion rather than in a retrospective way , and be dealt with in a single framework . this paper proposes a new topic analysis framework which satisfies this requirement from a unifying viewpoint that a topic structure is modeled using a finite mixture model and that any change of a topic trend is tracked by learning the finite mixture model dynamically . in this framework we propose the usage of a time stamp based discounting learning algorithm in order to realize real time topic structure identification . this enables tracking the topic structure adaptively by forgetting out of date statistics . further we apply the theory of dynamic model selection to detecting changes of main components in the finite mixture model in order to realize topic emergence detection . we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework using real data collected at a help desk to show that we are able to track dynamics of topic trends in a timely fashion . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> database management database applications data mining

unwanted traffic in 3g networks . <eos> the presence of unwanted ( or background ) traffic in the internet is a well known fact . in principle any network that has been engineered without taking its presence into account might experience troubles during periods of massive exposure to unwanted traffic , e . g . during large scale infections . a concrete example was provided by the spreading of code red ii in <digit> , which caused several routers crashes worldwide . similar events might take place in 3g networks as well , with further potential complications arising from their high functional complexity and the scarcity of radio resources . for example , under certain hypothetical network configuration settings unwanted traffic , and specifically scanning traffic from infected mobile stations , can cause large scale wastage of logical resources , and in extreme cases even starvation . unwanted traffic is present nowdays also in gprs umts , mainly due to the widespread use of 3g connect cards for laptops . we urge the research community and network operators to consider the issue of 3g robustness to unwanted traffic as a prominent research area . categories and subject descriptors c . <digit> . <digit> network operations public networks , network monitoring . general terms security , reliability , measurement .

using roles and business objects to model and understand business processes . <eos> business process modeling focus on describing how activities interact with other business objects while sustaining the organization ' s strategy . business objects are object oriented representations of organizational concepts , such as resources and actors , which collaborate with one another in order to achieve business goals . these objects exhibit different behavior according to each specific collaboration context . this means the perception of a business object depends on its collaborations with other objects . business process modeling techniques do not clearly separate the multiple collaborative aspects of a business object from its internal aspects , making it difficult to understand objects which are used in different contexts , thus hindering reuse . to cope with such issues , this paper proposes using role modeling as a separation of concerns mechanism to increase the understandability and reusability of business process models . the approach divides a business process model into a business object model and a role model . the business object models deals with specifying the structure and intrinsic behavior of business objects while the role model specifies its collaborative aspects . categories and subject descriptors d . <digit> . <digit> management software process models d . <digit> . <digit> design methodologies h . <digit> . <digit> models and principles general

what ' s there and what ' s not focused crawling for missing documents in digital libraries . <eos> some large scale topical digital libraries , such as citeseer , harvest online academic documents by crawling open access archives , university and author homepages , and authors ' self submissions . while these approaches have so far built reasonable size libraries , they can suffer from having only a portion of the documents from specific publishing venues . we propose to use alternative online resources and techniques that maximally exploit other resources to build the complete document collection of any given publication venue . we investigate the feasibility of using publication metadata to guide the crawler towards authors ' homepages to harvest what is missing from a digital library collection . we collect a real world dataset from two computer science publishing venues , involving a total of <digit> unique authors over a time frame of <digit> to <digit> . we then identify the missing papers that are not indexed by citeseer . using a fully automatic heuristic based system that has the capability of locating authors ' homepages and then using focused crawling to download the desired papers , we demonstrate that it is practical to harvest using a focused crawler academic papers that are missing from our digital library . our harvester achieves a performance with an average recall level of <digit> . <digit> overall and <digit> . <digit> for those missing documents . evaluation of the crawler ' s performance based on the harvest rate shows definite advantages over other crawling approaches and consistently outperforms a defined baseline crawler on a number of measures . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> information systems information storage and retrieval , digital libraries general terms algorithms , performance , design , experimentation .
a two phase sampling technique for information extraction from hidden web databases . <eos> hidden web databases maintain a collection of specialised documents , which are dynamically generated in response to users ' queries . however , the documents are generated by web page templates , which contain information that is irrelevant to queries . this paper presents a two phase sampling ( 2ps ) technique that detects templates and extracts query related information from the sampled documents of a database . in the first phase , 2ps queries databases with terms contained in their search interface pages and the subsequently sampled documents . this process retrieves a required number of documents . in the second phase , 2ps detects web page templates in the sampled documents in order to extract information relevant to queries . we test 2ps on a number of real world hidden web databases . experimental results demonstrate that 2ps effectively eliminates irrelevant information contained in web page templates and generates terms and frequencies with improved accuracy . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> information storage and retrieval online information services web based services . general terms algorithms , experimentation .

agent technology for personalized information filtering the pia system . <eos> as today the amount of accessible information is overwhelming , the intelligent and personalized filtering of available information is a main challenge . additionally , there is a growing need for the seamless mobile and multi modal system usage throughout the whole day to meet the requirements of the modern society ( anytime , anywhere , anyhow ) . a personal information agent that is delivering the right information at the right time by accessing , filtering and presenting information in a situation aware matter is needed . applying agent technology is promising , because the inherent capabilities of agents like autonomy , pro and reactiveness offer an adequate approach . we developed an agent based personal information system called pia for collecting , filtering , and integrating information at a common point , offering access to the information by www , e mail , sms , mms , and j2me clients . push and pull techniques are combined allowing the user to search explicitly for specific information on the one hand and to be informed automatically about relevant information divided in pre , work and recreation slots on the other hand . in the core of the pia system advanced filtering techniques are deployed through multiple filtering agent communities for content based and collaborative filtering . information extracting agents are constantly gathering new relevant information from a variety of selected sources ( internet , files , databases , web services etc . ) . a personal agent for each user is managing the individual information provisioning , tailored to the needs of this specific user , knowing the profile , the current situation and learning from feedback . categories and subject descriptors information systems information systems applications general , communications applications . general terms algorithms , management
an adaptive information retrieval system based on associative networks . <eos> in this paper we present a multilingual information retrieval system that provides access to tourism information by exploiting the intuitiveness of natural language . in particular , we describe the knowledge representation model underlying the information retrieval system . this knowledge representation approach is based on associative networks and allows the definition of semantic relationships between domain intrinsic information items . the network structure is used to define weighted associations between information items and augments the system with a fuzzy search strategy . this particular search strategy is performed by a constrained spreading activation algorithm that implements information retrieval on associative networks . strictly speaking , we take the relatedness of terms into account and show , how this fuzzy search strategy yields beneficial results and , moreover , determines highly associated matches to users ' queries . thus , the combination of the associative network and the constrained spreading activation approach constitutes a search algorithm that evaluates the relatedness of terms and , therefore , provides a means for implicit query expansion .
an analytical model based on g m <digit> with self similar input to provide end to end qos in 3g networks . <eos> the dramatic increase in demand for wireless internet access has lead to the introduction of new wireless architectures and systems including 3g , wi fi and wimax . 3g systems such as umts and cdma2000 are leaning towards an all ip architecture for transporting ip multimedia services , mainly due to its scalability and promising capability of inter working heterogeneous wireless access networks . during the last ten years , substantial work has been done to understand the nature of wired ip traffic and it has been proven that ip traffic exhibits self similar properties and burstiness over a large range of time scales . recently , because of the large deployment of new wireless architectures , researchers have focused their attention towards understanding the nature of traffic carried by different wireless architecture and early studies have shown that wireless data traffic also exhibits strong long range dependency . thus , the classical tele traffic theory based on a simple markovian process can not be used to evaluate the performance of wireless networks . unfortunately , the area of understanding and modeling of different kinds of wireless traffic is still immature which constitutes a problem since it is crucial to guarantee tight bound qos parameters to heterogeneous end users of the mobile internet . in this paper , we make several contributions to the accurate modeling of wireless ip traffic by presenting a novel analytical model that takes into account four different classes of self similar traffic . the model consists of four queues and is based on a g m <digit> queueing system . we analyze it on the basis of priority with no preemption and find exact packet delays . to date , no closed form expressions have been presented for g m <digit> with priority . categories and subject descriptors c . <digit> . <digit> . computer communication networks network management g . <digit> . mathematics of computing queueing theory , markov processes general terms theory , design , performance , reliability
a computational approach to reflective meta reasoning about languages with bindings . <eos> we present a foundation for a computational meta theory of languages with bindings implemented in a computer aided formal reasoning environment . our theory provides the ability to reason abstractly about operators , languages , open ended languages , classes of languages , etc . the theory is based on the ideas of higher order abstract syntax , with an appropriate induction principle parameterized over the language ( i . e . a set of operators ) being used . in our approach , both the bound and free variables are treated uniformly and this uniform treatment extends naturally to variable length bindings . the implementation is reflective , namely there is a natural mapping between the meta language of the theorem prover and the object language of our theory . the object language substitution operation is mapped to the meta language substitution and does not need to be defined recursively . our approach does not require designing a custom type theory in this paper we describe the implementation of this foundational theory within a general purpose type theory . this work is fully implemented in the metaprl theorem prover , using the pre existing nuprl like martin lof style computational type theory . based on this implementation , we lay out an outline for a framework for programming language experimentation and exploration as well as a general reflective reasoning framework . this paper also includes a short survey of the existing approaches to syntactic reflection . categories and subject descriptors d . <digit> . <digit> programming languages formal definitions and theory syntax f . <digit> . <digit> mathematical logic and formal languages formal languages operations on languages general terms languages , theory , verification
an architectural style for high performance asymmetrical parallel computations . <eos> researchers with deep knowledge of scientific domains are now developing highly adaptive and irregular ( asymmetrical ) parallel computations , leading to challenges in both delivery of data for computation and mapping of processes to physical resources . using software engineering principles , we have developed a new communications protocol and architectural style for asymmetrical parallel computations called adapt . utilizing the support of architecturally aware middleware , we show that adapt provides a more efficient solution in terms of message passing and load balancing than asymmetrical parallel computations using collective calls in the message passing interface ( mpi ) or more advanced frameworks implementing explicit load balancing policies . additionally , developers using adapt gain significant windfall from good practices in software engineering , including implementation level support of architectural artifacts and separation of computational loci from communication protocols categories and subject descriptors d . <digit> . <digit> software engineering software architectures general terms design , performance

an expressive aspect language for system applications with arachne . <eos> c applications , in particular those using operating system level services , frequently comprise multiple crosscutting concerns network protocols and security are typical examples of such concerns . while these concerns can partially be addressed during design and implementation of an application , they frequently become an issue at runtime , e . g . , to avoid server downtime . a deployed network protocol might not be efficient enough and may thus need to be replaced . buffer overflows might be discovered that imply critical breaches in the security model of an application . a prefetching strategy may be required to enhance performance . while aspect oriented programming seems attractive in this context , none of the current aspect systems is expressive and efficient enough to address such concerns . this paper presents a new aspect system to provide a solution to this problem . while efficiency considerations have played an important part in the design of the aspect language , the language allows aspects to be expressed more concisely than previous approaches . in particular , it allows aspect programmers to quantify over sequences of execution points as well as over accesses through variable aliases . we show how the former can be used to modularize the replacement of network protocols and the latter to prevent buffer overflows . we also present an implementation of the language as an extension of arachne , a dynamic weaver for c applications . finally , we present performance evaluations supporting that arachne is fast enough to extend high performance applications , such as the squid web cache .

an integrated environment to visually construct 3d animations . <eos> in this paper , we present an expressive 3d animation environment that enables users to rapidly and visually prototype animated worlds with a fully 3d user interface . a 3d device allows the specification of complex 3d motion , while virtual tools are visible mediators that live in the same 3d space as application objects and supply the interaction metaphors to control them . in our environment , there is no intrinsic difference between user interface and application objects . multi way constraints provide the necessary tight coupling among components that makes it possible to seamlessly compose animated and interactive behaviors . by recording the effects of manipulations , all the expressive power of the 3d user interface is exploited to define animations . effective editing of recorded manipulations is made possible by compacting all continuous parameter evolutions with an incremental data reduction algorithm , designed to preserve both geometry and timing . the automatic generation of editable representations of interactive performances overcomes one of the major limitations of current performance animation systems . novel interactive solutions to animation problems are made possible by the tight integration of all system components . in particular , animations can be synchronized by using constrained manipulation during playback . the accompanying video tape illustrates our approach with interactive sequences showing the visual construction of 3d animated worlds . all the demonstrations in the video were recorded live and were not edited .
an intensional approach to the specification of test cases for database applications . <eos> when testing database applications , in addition to creating in memory fixtures it is also necessary to create an initial database state that is appropriate for each test case . current approaches either require exact database states to be specified in advance , or else generate a single initial state ( under guidance from the user ) that is intended to be suitable for execution of all test cases . the first method allows large test suites to be executed in batch , but requires considerable programmer effort to create the test cases ( and to maintain them ) . the second method requires less programmer effort , but increases the likelihood that test cases will fail in non fault situations , due to unexpected changes to the content of the database . in this paper , we propose a new approach in which the database states required for testing are specified intensionally , as constrained queries , that can be used to prepare the database for testing automatically . this technique overcomes the limitations of the other approaches , and does not appear to impose significant performance overheads . categories and subject descriptors d . <digit> . <digit> software engineering testing and debugging testing tools general terms experimentation , verification

aspect oriented programming for a component based real life application a case study . <eos> aspect oriented programming , a relatively new programming paradigm , earned the scientific community ' s attention . the paradigm is already evaluated for traditional oop and component based software development with remarkable results . however , most of the published work , while of excellent quality , is mostly theoretical or involves evaluation of aop for research oriented and experimental software . unlike the previous work , this study considers the aop paradigm for solving real life problems , which can be faced in any commercial software . we evaluate aop in the development of a high performance component based web crawling system , and compare the process with the development of the same system without aop . the results of the case study mostly favor the aspect oriented paradigm .
attack resilient hierarchical data aggregation in sensor networks . <eos> in a large sensor network , in network data aggregation , i . e . , combining partial results at intermediate nodes during message routing , significantly reduces the amount of communication and hence the energy consumed . recently several researchers have proposed robust aggregation frameworks , which combine multi path routing schemes with duplicate insensitive algorithms , to accurately compute aggregates ( e . g . , sum , count , average ) in spite of message losses resulting from node and transmission failures . however , these aggregation frameworks have been designed without security in mind . given the lack of hardware support for tamper resistance and the unattended nature of sensor nodes , sensor networks are highly vulnerable to node compromises . we show that even if a few compromised nodes contribute false sub aggregate values , this results in large errors in the aggregate computed at the root of the hierarchy . we present modifications to the aggregation algorithms that guard against such attacks , i . e . , we present algorithms for resilient hierarchical data aggregation despite the presence of compromised nodes in the aggregation hierarchy . we evaluate the performance and costs of our approach via both analysis and simulation . our results show that our approach is scalable and efficient . categories and subject descriptors c . <digit> . <digit> computer communication networks general security and protection c . <digit> . <digit> computer communication networks network architecture and design wireless communication d . <digit> . <digit> operating systems security and protection cryptographic controls k . <digit> . <digit> management of computing and information systems security and protection general terms algorithms , design , security
automated rich presentation of a semantic topic . <eos> to have a rich presentation of a topic , it is not only expected that many relevant multimodal information , including images , text , audio and video , could be extracted it is also important to organize and summarize the related information , and provide users a concise and informative storyboard about the target topic . it facilitates users to quickly grasp and better understand the content of a topic . in this paper , we present a novel approach to automatically generating a rich presentation of a given semantic topic . in our proposed approach , the related multimodal information of a given topic is first extracted from available multimedia databases or websites . since each topic usually contains multiple events , a text based event clustering algorithm is then performed with a generative model . other media information , such as the representative images , possibly available video clips and flashes ( interactive animates ) , are associated with each related event . a storyboard of the target topic is thus generated by integrating each event and its corresponding multimodal information . finally , to make the storyboard more expressive and attractive , an incidental music is chosen as background and is aligned with the storyboard . a user study indicates that the presented system works quite well on our testing examples . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> information interfaces and presentation group and organization interfaces organizational design h . <digit> . <digit> information storage and retrieval content analysis and indexing abstracting methods . general terms algorithms , design , management , experimentation , theory

automatic extraction of titles from general documents using machine learning . <eos> in this paper , we propose a machine learning approach to title extraction from general documents . by general documents , we mean documents that can belong to any one of a number of specific genres , including presentations , book chapters , technical papers , brochures , reports , and letters . previously , methods have been proposed mainly for title extraction from research papers . it has not been clear whether it could be possible to conduct automatic title extraction from general documents . as a case study , we consider extraction from office including word and powerpoint . in our approach , we annotate titles in sample documents ( for word and powerpoint respectively ) and take them as training data , train machine learning models , and perform title extraction using the trained models . our method is unique in that we mainly utilize formatting information such as font size as features in the models . it turns out that the use of formatting information can lead to quite accurate extraction from general documents . precision and recall for title extraction from word is <digit> . <digit> and <digit> . <digit> respectively , and precision and recall for title extraction from powerpoint is <digit> . <digit> and <digit> . <digit> respectively in an experiment on intranet data . other important new findings in this work include that we can train models in one domain and apply them to another domain , and more surprisingly we can even train models in one language and apply them to another language . moreover , we can significantly improve search ranking results in document retrieval by using the extracted titles . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> information storage and retrieval information search and retrieval search process h . <digit> . <digit> information systems applications office automation word processing d . <digit> . <digit> software engineering metrics complexity measures , performance measures general terms algorithms , experimentation , performance .
autonomous and distributed node recovery in wireless sensor networks . <eos> intrusion or misbehaviour detection systems are an important and widely accepted security tool in computer and wireless sensor networks . their aim is to detect misbehaving or faulty nodes in order to take appropriate countermeasures , thus limiting the damage caused by adversaries as well as by hard or software faults . so far , however , once detected , misbehaving nodes have just been isolated from the rest of the sensor network and hence are no longer usable by running applications . in the presence of an adversary or software faults , this proceeding will inevitably lead to an early and complete loss of the whole network . for this reason , we propose to no longer expel misbehaving nodes , but to recover them into normal operation . in this paper , we address this problem and present a formal specification of what is considered a secure and correct node recovery algorithm together with a distributed algorithm that meets these properties . we discuss its requirements on the soft and hardware of a node and show how they can be fulfilled with current and upcoming technologies . the algorithm is evaluated analytically as well as by means of extensive simulations , and the findings are compared to the outcome of a real implementation for the btnode sensor platform . the results show that recovering sensor nodes is an expensive , though feasible and worthwhile task . moreover , the proposed program code update algorithm is not only secure but also fair and robust . categories and subject descriptors c . <digit> . <digit> computer communication networks general security and protection general terms algorithms , reliability , security

black box constructions for secure computation . <eos> it is well known that the secure computation of non trivial functionalities in the setting of no honest majority requires computational assumptions . we study the way such computational assumptions are used . specifically , we ask whether the secure protocol can use the underlying primitive ( e . g . , one way trapdoor permutation ) in a black box way , or must it be nonblack box ( by referring to the code that computes this primitive ) despite the fact that many general constructions of cryptographic schemes ( e . g . , cpa secure encryption ) refer to the underlying primitive in a black box way only , there are some constructions that are inherently nonblack box . indeed , all known constructions of protocols for general secure computation that are secure in the presence of a malicious adversary and without an honest majority use the underlying primitive in a nonblack box way ( requiring to prove in zero knowledge statements that relate to the primitive ) . in this paper , we study whether such nonblack box use is essential . we present protocols that use only black box access to a family of ( enhanced ) trapdoor permutations or to a homomorphic public key encryption scheme . the result is a protocol whose communication complexity is independent of the computational complexity of the underlying primitive ( e . g . , a trapdoor permutation ) and whose computational complexity grows only linearly with that of the underlying primitive . this is the first protocol to exhibit these properties . categories and subject descriptors f . <digit> . <digit> theory of computation interactive and reactive computation research supported by grant <digit> <digit> from the israel science foundation . department of computer science , technion , israel . email <unk> , <unk> , erez cs . technion . ac . il general terms algorithms , theory

compression of inverted indexes for fast query evaluation . <eos> compression reduces both the size of indexes and the time needed to evaluate queries . in this paper , we revisit the compression of inverted lists of document postings that store the position and frequency of indexed terms , considering two approaches to improving retrieval efficiency better implementation and better choice of integer compression schemes . first , we propose several simple optimisations to well known integer compression schemes , and show experimentally that these lead to significant reductions in time . second , we explore the impact of choice of compression scheme on retrieval efficiency . in experiments on large collections of data , we show two surprising results use of simple byte aligned codes halves the query evaluation time compared to the most compact golomb rice bitwise compression schemes and , even when an index fits entirely in memory , byte aligned codes result in faster query evaluation than does an uncompressed index , emphasising that the cost of transferring data from memory to the cpu cache is less for an appropriately compressed index than for an uncompressed index . moreover , byte aligned schemes have only a modest space overhead the most compact schemes result in indexes that are around <digit> % of the size of the collection , while a byte aligned scheme is around <digit> % . we conclude that fast byte aligned codes should be used to store integers in inverted lists . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> information storage and retrieval systems and software performance evaluation ( efficiency and effectiveness ) e . <digit> data coding and information theory data compaction and compression general terms performance , algorithms , design

consistent query answering under key and exclusion dependencies algorithms and experiments . <eos> research in consistent query answering studies the definition and computation of meaningful answers to queries posed to inconsistent databases , i . e . , databases whose data do not satisfy the integrity constraints ( ics ) declared on their schema . computing consistent answers to conjunctive queries is generally conp hard in data complexity , even in the presence of very restricted forms of ics ( single , unary keys ) . recent studies on consistent query answering for database schemas containing only key dependencies have an <unk> the possibility of identifying classes of queries whose consistent answers can be obtained by a first order rewriting of the query , which in turn can be easily formulated in sql and directly evaluated through any relational dbms . in this paper we study consistent query answering in the presence of key dependencies and exclusion dependencies . we first prove that even in the presence of only exclusion dependencies the problem is conp hard in data complexity , and define a general method for consistent answering of conjunctive queries under key and exclusion dependencies , based on the rewriting of the query in datalog with negation . then , we identify a subclass of conjunctive queries that can be first order rewritten in the presence of key and exclusion dependencies , and define an algorithm for computing the first order rewriting of a query belonging to such a class of queries . finally , we compare the relative efficiency of the two methods for processing queries in the subclass above mentioned . experimental results , conducted on a real and large database of the computer science engineering degrees of the university of rome la sapienza , clearly show the computational advantage of the first order based technique . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> database management languages query languages f . <digit> . <digit> analysis of algorithms and problem complexity general . general terms theory , algorithms , experimentation .

contour based partial object recognition using symmetry in image databases . <eos> this paper discusses the problem of partial object recognition in image databases . we propose the method to reconstruct and estimate partially occluded shapes and regions of objects in images from overlapping and cutting . we present the robust method for recognizing partially occluded objects based on symmetry properties , which is based on the contours of objects . our method provides simple techniques to reconstruct occluded regions via a region copy using the symmetry axis within an object . based on the estimated parameters for partially occluded objects , we perform object recognition on the classification tree . since our method relies on reconstruction of the object based on the symmetry rather than statistical estimates , it has proven to be remarkably robust in recognizing partially occluded objects in the presence of scale changes , rotation , and viewpoint changes .
<unk> an entropy based algorithm for categorical clustering . <eos> in this paper we explore the connection between clustering categorical data and entropy clusters of similar poi lower entropy than those of dissimilar ones . we use this connection to design an incremental heuristic algorithm , <unk> , which is capable of efficiently clustering large data sets of records with categorical attributes , and data streams . in contrast with other categorical clustering algorithms published in the past , <unk> ' s clustering results are very stable for different sample sizes and parameter settings . also , the criteria for clustering is a very intuitive one , since it is deeply rooted on the well known notion of entropy . most importantly , <unk> is well equipped to deal with clustering of data streams ( continuously arriving streams of data point ) since it is an incremental algorithm capable of clustering new points without having to look at every point that has been clustered so far . we demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of <unk> by a series of experiments on real and synthetic data sets . categories and subject descriptors i . <digit> . <digit> computing methodologies pattern recognition clustering general terms entropy

coupling feature selection and machine learning methods for navigational query identification . <eos> it is important yet hard to identify navigational queries in web search due to a lack of sufficient information in web queries , which are typically very short . in this paper we study several machine learning methods , including naive bayes model , maximum entropy model , support vector machine ( svm ) , and stochastic gradient boosting tree ( sgbt ) , for navigational query identification in web search . to boost the performance of these machine techniques , we exploit several feature selection methods and propose coupling feature selection with classification approaches to achieve the best performance . different from most prior work that uses a small number of features , in this paper , we study the problem of identifying navigational queries with thousands of available features , extracted from major commercial search engine results , web search user click data , query log , and the whole web ' s relational content . a multi level feature extraction system is constructed . our results on real search data show that <digit> ) among all the features we tested , user click distribution features are the most important set of features for identifying navigational queries . <digit> ) in order to achieve good performance , machine learning approaches have to be coupled with good feature selection methods . we find that gradient boosting tree , coupled with linear svm feature selection is most effective . <digit> ) with carefully coupled feature selection and classification approaches , navigational queries can be accurately identified with <digit> . <digit> % f1 score , which is <digit> % error rate reduction compared to the best uncoupled system , and <digit> % error rate reduction compared to a well tuned system without feature selection . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> information systems applications miscellaneous dr . peng contributes to this paper equally as dr . lu . general terms experimentation

data mining in metric space an empirical analysis of supervised learning performance criteria . <eos> many criteria can be used to evaluate the performance of supervised learning . different criteria are appropriate in different settings , and it is not always clear which criteria to use . a further complication is that learning methods that perform well on one criterion may not perform well on other criteria . for example , svms and boosting are designed to optimize accuracy , whereas neural nets typically optimize squared error or cross entropy . we conducted an empirical study using a variety of learning methods ( svms , neural nets , k nearest neighbor , bagged and boosted trees , and boosted stumps ) to compare nine boolean classification performance metrics accuracy , lift , f score , area under the roc curve , average precision , precision recall break even point , squared error , cross entropy , and probability calibration . multidimensional scaling ( mds ) shows that these metrics span a low dimensional manifold . the three metrics that are appropriate when predictions are interpreted as probabilities squared error , cross entropy , and calibration , lay in one part of metric space far away from metrics that depend on the relative order of the predicted values roc area , average precision , break even point , and lift . in between them fall two metrics that depend on comparing predictions to a threshold accuracy and f score . as expected , maximum margin methods such as svms and boosted trees have excellent performance on metrics like accuracy , but perform poorly on probability metrics such as squared error . what was not expected was that the margin methods have excellent performance on ordering metrics such as roc area and average precision . we introduce a new metric , sar , that combines squared error , accuracy , and roc area into one metric . mds and correlation analysis shows that sar is centrally located and correlates well with other metrics , suggesting that it is a good general purpose metric to use when more specific criteria are not known . categories subject descriptors i . <digit> . <digit> pattern recognition design methodology classifier design evaluation . general terms algorithms , measurement , performance , experimentation .

dbblue low diameter and self routing bluetooth scatternet . <eos> this paper addresses the problem of scatternet formation for single hop bluetooth based ad hoc networks , with minimal communication overhead . we adopt the well known structure de bruijn graph to form the backbone of bluetooth scatternet , hereafter called dbblue , such that every master node has at most seven slaves , every slave node is in at most two piconets , and no node assumes both master and slave roles . our structure dbblue also enjoys a nice routing property the diameter of the graph is and we can find a path with at most hops for every pair of nodes without any routing table . moreover , the congestion of every node is at most , assuming that a unit of total traffic demand is equally distributed among all pair of nodes . we discuss in detail a vigorous method to locally update the structure dbblue using at most communications when a node joins or leaves the network . in most cases , the cost of updating the scatternet is actually since a node can join or leave without affecting the remaining scatternet . the number of nodes affected when a node joins or leaves the network is always bounded from above by a constant . to facilitate self routing and easy updating , we design a scalable mac assigning mechanism for piconet , which guarantees the packet delivery during scatternet updating . the dbblue scatternet can be constructed incrementally when the nodes join the network one by one . previously no method can guarantee all these properties although some methods can achieve some of the properties . categories and subject descriptors c . <digit> . <digit> network architecture and design wireless communication , network topology g . <digit> . <digit> graph theory network problems , graph algorithms general terms algorithms , design , theory

diagnosis of tcp overlay connection failures using bayesian networks . <eos> when failures occur in internet overlay connections today , it is difficult for users to determine the root cause of failure . an overlay connection may require tcp connections between a series of overlay nodes to succeed , but accurately determining which of these connections has failed is difficult for users without access to the internal workings of the overlay . diagnosis using active probing is costly and may be inaccurate if probe packets are filtered or blocked . to address this problem , we develop a passive diagnosis approach that infers the most likely cause of failure using a bayesian network modeling the conditional probability of tcp failures given the ip addresses of the hosts along the overlay path . we collect tcp failure data for <digit> . <digit> million tcp connections using data from the new planetseer overlay monitoring system and train a bayesian network for the diagnosis of overlay connection failures . we evaluate the accuracy of diagnosis using this bayesian network on a set of overlay connections generated from observations of codeen traffic patterns and find that our approach can accurately diagnose failures .

a fair and traffic dependent scheduling algorithm for bluetooth scatternets . <eos> mechanisms and algorithms necessary to set up and maintain them . the operation of a scatternet requires some bluetooth units to be inter piconet units ( gateways ) , which need to time division multiplex their presence among their piconets . this requires a scatternet scheduling algorithm that can schedule the presence of these units in an efficient manner . in this paper , we propose a distributed scatternet scheduling scheme that is implemented using the hold mode of bluetooth and adapts to non uniform and changing traffic . another attribute of the scheme is that it results in fair allocation of bandwidth to each bluetooth unit . this scheme provides an integrated solution for both intra and inter piconet scheduling , i . e . , for polling of slaves and scheduling of gateways .

downloading textual hidden web content through keyword queries . <eos> an ever increasing amount of information on the web today is available only through search interfaces the users have to type in a set of keywords in a search form in order to access the pages from certain web sites . these pages are often referred to as the hidden web or the deep web . since there are no static links to the hidden web pages , search engines can not discover and index such pages and thus do not return them in the results . however , according to recent studies , the content provided by many hidden web sites is often of very high quality and can be extremely valuable to many users . in this paper , we study how we can build an effective hidden web crawler that can autonomously discover and download pages from the hidden web . since the only entry point to a hidden web site is a query interface , the main challenge that a hidden web crawler has to face is how to automatically generate meaningful queries to issue to the site . here , we provide a theoretical framework to investigate the query generation problem for the hidden web and we propose effective policies for generating queries automatically . our policies proceed iteratively , issuing a different query in every iteration . we experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of these policies on <digit> real hidden web sites and our results are very promising . for instance , in one experiment , one of our policies downloaded more than <digit> % of a hidden web site ( that contains <digit> million documents ) after issuing fewer than <digit> queries . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> information systems digital libraries h . <digit> . <digit> information systems content analysis and indexing h . <digit> . <digit> information systems information search and retrieval . general terms algorithms , performance , design .
easy language extension with meta aspectj . <eos> domain specific languages hold the potential of automating the software development process . nevertheless , the <unk> tion of a domain specific language is hindered by the difficulty of transitioning to different language syntax and employing a separate translator in the software build process . we present a methodology that simplifies the development and deployment of small language extensions , in the context of java . the main language design principle is that of language extension through unobtrusive annotations . the main language implementation idea is to express the language as a generator of customized aspectj aspects , using our meta aspectj tool . the advantages of the approach are twofold . first , the tool integrates into an existing software application much as a regular api or library , instead of as a language extension . this means that the programmer can remove the language extension at any point and choose to implement the required functionality by hand without needing to rewrite the client code . second , a mature language implementation is easy to achieve with little effort since aspectj takes care of the low level issues of interfacing with the base java language . categories and subject descriptors d . <digit> . <digit> programming techniques automatic programming d . <digit> . <digit> software engineering reusable software d . <digit> . <digit> programming languages language constructs and features general terms domain specific languages , language extensions introduction and motivation the idea of extensible languages has fascinated programmers for many decades , as evident by the extensibility features in languages as old as lisp . from a software engineering standpoint , the main advantages of expressing a concept as a language feature , as opposed to a library api , are in terms of conciseness , safety , and performance . a language feature allows expressing the programmer ' s intent much more concisely in contrast , libraries are limited to a function or method call syntax . a language feature also allow better static error checking a library can only check the static types of arguments of a function call against the declared types of the formals . finally , a language feature can take advantage of context information and employ an optimized implementation , while a library routine can not be customized according to its uses . despite these advantages , there are excellent reasons why full language extensibility is undesirable . changing the syntax and semantics of a programming language is confusing and can lead to incomprehensible code . furthermore , programming languages are complex entities , designed to provide a small number of features but allow them to be combined as generally as possible . a new feature can either increase the complexity of the language implementation significantly ( because of interactions with all existing features ) , or will need to be limited in its interactions , which is a bad language design principle that leads to single use features and design bloat . in past work <digit> , we have advocated expressing small language extensions purely through unobtrusive annotations . indeed , the introduction of user defined annotations in mainstream programming languages , such as c and java , has allowed specialized language extensions ( e . g . , for distributed computing , persistence , or real time programming ) to be added without changing the base syntax . we believe that the approach of limited language extension through annotations meshes very well with an implementation technique that uses our meta aspectj ( maj ) tool <digit> to express the semantics of the language extension . specifically , maj is a language that allows writing programs that generate aspects in the aspectj language <digit> . the programmer can easily express an extension to the java language as a program that a ) reads annotations and type information from an existing program using java reflection b ) outputs a customized aspectj aspect that transforms the original program according to the information in the annotation c ) executes the generated aspect by using the standard aspectj compiler . in other words , our approach uses the aspectj language as a compiler back end . aspectj code is not written by the application programmer but generated by the language extension , for the sole purpose of expressing program transformations easily and generally . this is appropriate , as aspectj embodies the aspect oriented programming <digit> philosophy of expressing program enhancements orthogonally and independently of the original source code . our approach has the advantage of simplifying the implementation of the language extension significantly , without encouraging undisciplined language extension ( since the only extensions allowed are through annotations ) . specifically , the approach leverages the engineering sophistication of the aspectj compiler implementation and its provisions for dealing correctly with different java language features . if a programmer were to replicate the same effort by hand , she would likely need to reproduce much of the aspectj compiler complexity . the purpose of this paper is to support the idea of implementing small language extensions as programs that produce aspects . we have recently implemented a number of such small extensions to java and they all exhibit a striking simplicity . specifically , we did not have to implement ( or extend ) a java parser , we did not need to deal with syntax tree pattern matching and transformation , and we did not need to provide special handling for many java complexities . the combined annotations maj approach ensured that our small language extensions were implementable in a few hundreds of lines of code , without sacrificing generality in their conditions of use . we discuss two such extensions in detail , after first introducing the maj language .

efficient multi way text categorization via generalized discriminant analysis . <eos> text categorization is an important research area and has been receiving much attention due to the growth of the on line information and of internet . automated text categorization is generally cast as a multi class classification problem . much of previous work focused on binary document classification problems . support vector machines ( svms ) excel in binary classification , but the elegant theory behind large margin hyperplane can not be easily extended to multi class text classification . in addition , the training time and scaling are also important concerns . on the other hand , other techniques naturally extensible to handle multi class classification are generally not as accurate as svm . this paper presents a simple and efficient solution to multi class text categorization . classification problems are first formulated as optimization via discriminant analysis . text categorization is then cast as the problem of finding coordinate transformations that reflects the inherent similarity from the data . while most of the previous approaches decompose a multiclass classification problem into multiple independent binary classification tasks , the proposed approach enables direct multi class classification . by using generalized singular value decomposition ( gsvd ) , a coordinate transformation that reflects the inherent class structure indicated by the generalized singular values is identified . extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> information storage and retrieval information search and retrieval i . <digit> artificial intelligence learning i . <digit> pattern recognition applications general terms algorithms , measurement , performance , experimentation , verification
efficient phrase querying with an auxiliary index . <eos> search engines need to evaluate queries extremely fast , a challenging task given the vast quantities of data being indexed . a significant proportion of the queries posed to search engines involve phrases . in this paper we consider how phrase queries can be efficiently supported with low disk overheads . previous research has shown that phrase queries can be rapidly evaluated using nextword indexes , but these indexes are twice as large as conventional inverted files . we propose a combination of nextword indexes with inverted files as a solution to this problem . our experiments show that combined use of an auxiliary nextword index and a conventional inverted file allow evaluation of phrase queries in half the time required to evaluate such queries with an inverted file alone , and the space overhead is only <digit> % of the size of the inverted file . further time savings are available with only slight increases in disk requirements . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> information storage and retrieval systems and software evaluation ( efficiency ) e . <digit> data storage representations general terms algorithms , performance

queries enabling querying for semantic associations on the semantic web . <eos> this paper presents the notion of semantic associations as complex relationships between resource entities . these relationships capture both a connectivity of entities as well as similarity of entities based on a specific notion of similarity called isomorphism . it formalizes these notions for the rdf data model , by introducing a notion of a property sequence as a type . in the context of a graph model such as that for rdf , semantic associations amount to specific certain graph signatures . specifically , they refer to sequences ( i . e . directed paths ) here called property sequences , between entities , networks of property sequences ( i . e . undirected paths ) , or subgraphs of isomorphic property sequences . the ability to query about the existence of such relationships is fundamental to tasks in analytical domains such as national security and business intelligence , where tasks often focus on finding complex yet meaningful and obscured relationships between entities . however , support for such queries is lacking in contemporary query systems , including those for rdf . this paper discusses how querying for semantic associations might be enabled on the semantic web , through the use of an operator . it also discusses two approaches for processing queries on available persistent rdf stores and memory resident rdf data graphs , thereby building on current rdf query languages . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> information systems database <unk> languages general terms languages , theory , management
energy management schemes for memory resident database systems . <eos> with the tremendous growth of system memories , memory resident databases are increasingly becoming important in various domains . newer memories provide a structured way of storing data in multiple chips , with each chip having a bank of memory modules . current memory resident databases are yet to take full advantage of the banked storage system , which offers a lot of room for performance and energy optimizations . in this paper , we identify the implications of a banked memory environment in supporting memory resident databases , and propose hardware ( memory directed ) and software ( query directed ) schemes to reduce the energy consumption of queries executed on these databases . our results show that high level query directed schemes ( hosted in the query optimizer ) better utilize the low power modes in reducing the energy consumption than the respective hardware schemes ( hosted in the memory controller ) , due to their complete knowledge of query access patterns . we extend this further and propose a query restructuring scheme and a multi query optimization . queries are restructured and regrouped based on their table access patterns to maximize the likelihood that data accesses are clustered . this helps increase the inter access idle times of memory modules , which in turn enables a more effective control of their energy behavior . this heuristic is eventually integrated with our hardware optimizations to achieve maximum savings . our experimental results show that the memory energy reduces by <digit> % if query restructuring method is applied along with basic energy optimizations over the unoptimized version . the system wide performance impact of each scheme is also studied simultaneously . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> database management physical design access methods h . <digit> . <digit> information storage and retrieval information storage b . <digit> . <digit> memory structures semiconductor memories dram general terms design , performance
enforcing security and safety models with an information flow analysis tool . <eos> existing security models require that information of a given security level be prevented from leaking into lower security information . high security applications must be demonstrably free of such leaks , but such demonstration may require substantial manual analysis . other authors have argued that the natural way to enforce these models automatically is with information flow analysis , but have not shown this to be practicable for general purpose programming languages in current use . modern safety critical systems can contain software components with differing safety integrity levels , potentially operating in the same address space . this case poses problems similar to systems with differing security levels failure to show separation of data may require the entire system to be validated at the higher integrity level . in this paper we show how the information flow model enforced by the spark examiner provides support for enforcing these security and safety models . we describe an extension to the spark variable annotations which allows the specification of a security or safety level for each state variable , and an extension to the spark analysis which automatically enforces a given information flow policy on a spark program . categories and subject descriptors d2 . <digit> software engineering software program verification f3 . <digit> logics and meanings of programs specifying and verifying and reasoning about programs general terms design , measurement , security , verification
entropy and self organization in multi agent systems . <eos> emergent self organization in multi agent systems appears to contradict the second law of thermodynamics . this paradox has been explained in terms of a coupling between the macro level that hosts self organization ( and an apparent reduction in entropy ) , and the micro level ( where random processes greatly increase entropy ) . metaphorically , the micro level serves as an entropy sink , permitting overall system entropy to increase while sequestering this increase from the interactions where self organization is desired . we make this metaphor precise by constructing a simple example of pheromone based coordination , defining a way to measure the shannon entropy at the macro ( agent ) and micro ( pheromone ) levels , and exhibiting an entropy based view of the coordination .
entropy based sensor selection heuristic for target localization . <eos> we propose an entropy based sensor selection heuristic for localization . given <digit> ) a prior probability distribution of the target location , and <digit> ) the locations and the sensing models of a set of candidate sensors for selection , the heuristic selects an informative sensor such that the fusion of the selected sensor observation with the prior target location distribution would yield on average the greatest or nearly the greatest reduction in the entropy of the target location distribution . the heuristic greedily selects one sensor in each step without retrieving any actual sensor observations . the heuristic is also computationally much simpler than the mutual information based approaches . the effectiveness of the heuristic is evaluated using localization simulations in which gaussian sensing models are assumed for simplicity . the heuristic is more effective when the optimal candidate sensor is more informative . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> models and principles systems and information theory information theory c . <digit> . <digit> computer communication networks distributed systems distributed applications general terms algorithms , management , theory
estimating the global pagerank of web communities . <eos> localized search engines are small scale systems that index a particular community on the web . they offer several benefits over their large scale counterparts in that they are relatively inexpensive to build , and can provide more precise and complete search capability over their relevant domains . one disadvantage such systems have over large scale search engines is the lack of global pagerank values . such information is needed to assess the value of pages in the localized search domain within the context of the web as a whole . in this paper , we present well motivated algorithms to estimate the global pagerank values of a local domain . the algorithms are all highly scalable in that , given a local domain of size n , they use o ( n ) resources that include computation time , bandwidth , and storage . we test our methods across a variety of localized domains , including site specific domains and topic specific domains . we demonstrate that by crawling as few as n or 2n additional pages , our methods can give excellent global pagerank estimates . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> information storage and retrieval information search and retrieval g . <digit> . <digit> numerical analysis numerical linear algebra g . <digit> probability and statistics markov processes general terms pagerank , markov chain , stochastic complementation
evaluating similarity measures a large scale study in the orkut social network . <eos> online information services have grown too large for users to navigate without the help of automated tools such as collaborative filtering , which makes recommendations to users based on their collective past behavior . while many similarity measures have been proposed and individually evaluated , they have not been evaluated relative to each other in a large real world environment . we present an extensive empirical comparison of six distinct measures of similarity for recommending online communities to members of the orkut social network . we determine the usefulness of the different recommendations by actually measuring users ' propensity to visit and join recommended communities . we also examine how the ordering of recommendations influenced user selection , as well as interesting social issues that arise in recommending communities within a real social network . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> database management database applications data mining h . <digit> . <digit> information storage and retrieval online information services i . <digit> computing methodologies pattern recognition general terms algorithms , measurement , human factors
evaluation and evolution of a browse and search interface relation browser . <eos> we present in this paper the design and an evaluation of a novel interface called the relation browser ( rb ) for searching and browsing large information collections . rb provides visualized category overviews of an information space and allows dynamic filtering and exploration of the result set by tightly coupling the browsing and searching functions . a user study was conducted to compare the effectiveness , efficiency and user satisfaction of completing various types of searching and browsing using the rb interface and a traditional form fillin interface for a video library . an exploration set of tasks was also included to examine the effectiveness of and user satisfaction with the rb when applied to a large federal statistics website . the comparison study strongly supported that rb was more effective , efficient , and satisfying for completing data exploration tasks . based on the results , efforts to automatically populate the underlying database using machine learning techniques are underway . preliminary implementations for two large scale federal statistical websites have been installed on government servers for internal evaluation . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> information interfaces and presentation ( e . g . hci ) user interface interaction style , graphical user interfaces ( gui ) h . <digit> . <digit> information storage and retrieval information search and retrieval query formulation , search process , selection process h . <digit> . <digit> information storage and retrieval digital libraries , user issues , systems issues general terms design , human factors , experimentation , performance
event threading within news topics . <eos> with the overwhelming volume of online news available today , there is an increasing need for automatic techniques to analyze and present news to the user in a meaningful and efficient manner . previous research focused only on organizing news stories by their topics into a flat hierarchy . we believe viewing a news topic as a flat collection of stories is too restrictive and inefficient for a user to understand the topic quickly . in this work , we attempt to capture the rich structure of events and their dependencies in a news topic through our event models . we call the process of recognizing events and their dependencies event threading . we believe our perspective of modeling the structure of a topic is more effective in capturing its semantics than a flat list of on topic stories . we formally define the novel problem , suggest evaluation metrics and present a few techniques for solving the problem . besides the standard word based features , our approaches take into account novel features such as temporal locality of stories for event recognition and time ordering for capturing dependencies . our experiments on a manually labeled data sets show that our models <unk> tively identify the events and capture dependencies among them . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . <digit> information search and retrieval clustering general terms algorithms , experimentation , measurement
evolutionary learning with kernels a generic solution for large margin problems . <eos> in this paper we embed evolutionary computation into statistical learning theory . first , we outline the connection between large margin optimization and statistical learning and see why this paradigm is successful for many pattern recognition problems . we then embed evolutionary computation into the most prominent representative of this class of learning methods , namely into support vector machines ( svm ) . in contrast to former applications of evolutionary algorithms to svms we do not only optimize the method or kernel parameters . we rather use both evolution strategies and particle swarm optimization in order to directly solve the posed constrained optimization problem . transforming the problem into the wolfe dual reduces the total runtime and allows the usage of kernel functions . exploiting the knowledge about this optimization problem leads to a hybrid mutation which further decreases convergence time while classification accuracy is preserved . we will show that evolutionary svms are at least as accurate as their quadratic programming counterparts on six real world benchmark data sets . the evolutionary svm variants frequently outperform their quadratic programming competitors . additionally , the proposed algorithm is more generic than existing traditional solutions since it will also work for non positive semidefinite kernel functions and for several , possibly competing , performance criteria . track learning classifier systems and other genetics based machine learning categories and subject descriptors learning general terms algorithms , theory , experimentation
a flexible and extensible object middleware corba and beyond . <eos> this paper presents a corba compliant middleware architecture that is more flexible and extensible compared to standard corba . the portable design of this architecture is easily integrated in any standard corba middleware for this purpose , mainly the handling of object references ( iors ) has to be changed . to encapsulate those changes , we introduce the concept of a generic reference manager with portable profile managers . profile managers are pluggable and in extreme can be downloaded on demand . to illustrate the use of this approach , we present a profile manager implementation for fragmented objects and another one for bridging corba to the jini world . the first profile manager supports truly distributed objects , which allow seamless integration of partitioning , scalability , fault tolerance , end to end quality of service , and many more implementation aspects into a distributed object without losing distribution and location transparency . the second profile manager illustrates how our architecture enables fully transparent access from corba applications to services on non corba platforms categories and subject descriptors d . <digit> . <digit> programming techniques object oriented programming d . <digit> . <digit> software engineering distribution , maintenance , and enhancement extensibility , portability d . <digit> . <digit> software engineering interoperability distributed objects general terms design , management , standardization
fan out measuring human control of multiple robots . <eos> a goal of human robot interaction is to allow one user to operate multiple robots simultaneously . in such a scenario the robots provide leverage to the user ' s attention . the number of such robots that can be operated is called the fan out of a human robot team . robots that have high neglect tolerance and lower interaction time will achieve higher fan out . we define an equation that relates fan out to a robot ' s activity time and its interaction time . we describe how to measure activity time and fan out . we then use the fan out equation to compute interaction effort . we can use this interaction effort as a measure of the effectiveness of a human robot interaction design . we describe experiments that validate the fan out equation and its use as a metric for improving human robot interaction . acm classification keywords h5 . <digit> user interfaces , i2 . <digit> robotics
fast string sorting using order preserving compression . <eos> we give experimental evidence for the benefits of order preserving compression in sorting algorithms . while , in general , any algorithm might benefit from compressed data because of reduced paging requirements , we identified two natural candidates that would further benefit from order preserving compression , namely string oriented sorting algorithms and word ram algorithms for keys of bounded length . the word ram model has some of the fastest known sorting algorithms in practice . these algorithms are designed for keys of bounded length , usually <digit> or <digit> bits , which limits their direct applicability for strings . one possibility is to use an order preserving compression scheme , so that a bounded key length algorithm can be applied . for the case of standard algorithms , we took what is considered to be the among the fastest nonword ram string sorting algorithms , fast <unk> , and measured its performance on compressed data . the fast <unk> algorithm of bentley and sedgewick is optimized to handle text strings . our experiments show that order compression techniques results in savings of approximately <digit> % over the same algorithm on noncompressed data . for the word ram , we modified andersson ' s sorting algorithm to handle variable length keys . the resulting algorithm is faster than the standard unix sort by a factor of <digit> . 5x . last , we used an order preserving scheme that is within a constant additive term of the optimal <unk> , but requires linear time rather than o ( m log m ) , where m is the size of the alphabet . categories and subject descriptors e . <digit> data storage contiguous representations , object representations e . <digit> coding and information theory data compaction and compression f . <digit> . <digit> analysis of algorithms and problem complexity general h . <digit> . <digit> information storage file organization h . <digit> . <digit> information search and retrieval search process general terms algorithms , experimentation , performance additional key words and phrases order preserving compression , sorting , word ram , unit cost ram

building bridges for web query classification . <eos> web query classification ( qc ) aims to classify web users ' queries , which are often short and ambiguous , into a set of target categories . qc has many applications including page ranking in web search , targeted advertisement in response to queries , and personalization . in this paper , we present a novel approach for qc that outperforms the winning solution of the acm kddcup <digit> competition , whose objective is to classify <digit> , <digit> real user queries . in our approach , we first build a bridging classifier on an intermediate taxonomy in an offline mode . this classifier is then used in an online mode to map user queries to the target categories via the above intermediate taxonomy . a major innovation is that by leveraging the similarity distribution over the intermediate taxonomy , we do not need to retrain a new classifier for each new set of target categories , and therefore the bridging classifier needs to be trained only once . in addition , we introduce category selection as a new method for narrowing down the scope of the intermediate taxonomy based on which we classify the queries . category selection can improve both efficiency and effectiveness of the online classification . by combining our algorithm with the winning solution of kddcup <digit> , we made an improvement by <digit> . <digit> % and <digit> . <digit> % in terms of precision and f1 respectively compared with the best results of kddcup <digit> . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit> . m information storage and retrieval miscellaneous i . <digit> . <digit> pattern recognition design methodology classifier design and evaluation general terms algorithms , experimentation
